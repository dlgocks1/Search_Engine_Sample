We have developed a small “shield” board for the Arduino Mini that allows us to easily prototype small battery-powered devices that contain motors, lights, speakers or sensors.  This shield adds the following features to the arduino board:
Battery charging of a lithium polymer or lithium ion battery
Voltage converter of battery voltage to 3.3V.  This will regulate any voltage in the range of 1.8-5.5V to 3.3V.  Without this the things that are powered would get less power as the battery dies (i.e. the lights would dim, motors would run slower)
8 MOSFETs that allow I/O pins to control higher current loads.  The arduino can only source 40mA from a single pin.  This allows a pin to control up to 5A of current.  This is necessary for things like motors or large banks of LEDs
The board can be snapped on top of the arduino board and looks like this when it’s all together:
Here’s how to wire it up:
We are currently talking to Spark Fun to see if we can have these made to be sold to the public.
Until then, we have made the eagle files and bill of materials available if you want to make your own.
