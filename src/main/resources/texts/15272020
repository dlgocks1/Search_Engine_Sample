Street Fighter Yomigaeru Fujiwara-Kyou
Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li are invited by E. Honda to see his new special move, but are all transported back to Fujiwara, the ancient capital of Japan. Ken finds Ryu and gives him a crash course on history and time travel and set off to find Chun-Li and Honda while giving random tidbits about the city.
This came out after the animated movie, but I am not sure of the exact date.
