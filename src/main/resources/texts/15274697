The American English r sound is one of the most complex sounds to describe and to produce. The r sound is created by narrowing the gap between your tongue and the top of your throat and by lifting the back of your tongue toward the soft palette at the back of your mouth and curving it up sharply at the sides so the edges of the tongue touch your teeth where your teeth meet flesh. The sound travels directly down the center of your tongue. Your lips should be somewhat tense, with the creases at the sides of your lips pulled away from each other.
When making the North American r sound, never touch the tip of your tongue to the tooth ridge at the front of your mouth. The tip of your tongue can be curled upward or set between your lower teeth as long as the tip of your tongue is not where its curve causes sound. The North American r sound also should not cause turbulence or friction at the back of your mouth.
For the General American Accent, it is important to learn to create a good, clear r sound no matter if the sound occurs first in the word, in the middle, or at the end of the word.
