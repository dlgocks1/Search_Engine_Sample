The head of a Russian charity organization and her husband have been found dead after being kidnapped in the restive republic of Chechnya.  The bodies of Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband, Alek Djabrailov, were found with gunshot wounds in the trunk of their own car in the Chernorechye suburb of the Chechen capital Grozny early on Tuesday.  On Monday, unknown gunmen had seized the couple from the offices of Sadulayeva's charity, “Let's Save the Generation”, which provides help for children affected by violence in Chechnya and works closely with the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF.  According to the Russian media, the victims were newlyweds in their mid-20s.   Tuesday's case came nearly a month after the abduction of prominent human rights activist, Natalia Estemirova, in the region, who was later found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia.   Estemirova had been investigating kidnappings and disappearances in Chechnya for the Russian human rights group, “Memorial”. The group has blamed her death on Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov.  The Chechen President vehemently denies the accusation.  HE/TG/DT
