Camera Genius is the camera app you wished your iPhone shipped with. Loaded with features you want in a camera app. 
To start with you can capture group photos just by saying "cheese" or making some noise. Now capture that perfect shot just when everyone is ready.
Anti-shake stabilization helps eliminate those blurry photos. 
A timer lets you setup timed group photos. You can set the interval between 2 and 30 seconds. Just tap the numbers when the timer pulls up to change the timing interval.
Finally the big photo button makes it easy to capture those photos without having to try and tap the tiny photo button potentially missing that candid shot. Just tap the screen to take the photo.
Camera guides help you compose and align photos based on known photographic principles.
We also keep track of the number of photos you are taking with a little reminder in the upper corner. Reset the count to zero by tapping it.
Start using this camera app today and you will quickly be replacing the default camera application.
