Abstract TopThe genetic code relates nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence and is shared across all organisms, with the rare exceptions of lineages in which one or a few codons have acquired novel assignments. Recoding of UGA from stop to tryptophan has evolved independently in certain reduced bacterial genomes, including those of the mycoplasmas and some mitochondria. Small genomes typically exhibit low guanine plus cytosine (GC) content, and this bias in base composition has been proposed to drive UGA Stop to Tryptophan (Stop→Trp) recoding. Using a combination of genome sequencing and high-throughput proteomics, we show that an α-Proteobacterial symbiont of cicadas has the unprecedented combination of an extremely small genome (144 kb), a GC–biased base composition (58.4%), and a coding reassignment of UGA Stop→Trp. Although it is not clear why this tiny genome lacks the low GC content typical of other small bacterial genomes, these observations support a role of genome reduction rather than base composition as a driver of codon reassignment.
Author Summary Top
The genetic code, which relates DNA sequence to protein sequence, is nearly universal across all life. Examples of recodings do exist, but new instances are rare. Genomes that exhibit recodings typically have other extreme properties, including reduced size, reduced gene sets, and low guanine plus cytosine (GC) content. The most common recoding event, the reassignment of UGA to Tryptophan instead of Stop (Stop→Trp), was previously known from several mitochondrial and one bacterial lineage, and it was proposed to be driven by extinction of the UGA codon due to reduction in GC content. Here we present an unusual bacterial genome from a symbiont of cicadas. It exhibits the UGA Stop→Trp reassignment, but has a high GC content, showing that reduction in GC content is not a necessary condition for this recoding. This symbiont genome is also the smallest known for any cellular organism. We therefore propose gene loss during genome reduction as the common force driving this code change in bacteria and organelles. Additionally, the extremely small size of the genome further obscures the once-clear distinction between organelle and autonomous bacterial life.

Introduction TopThe GC content of bacterial genomes has been known to vary widely since at least the 1950s [1]. Currently sequenced genomes range from 17–75% GC and show a strong correlation between genome size and GC content [2]–[4] (Figure 1). The tiny genomes of symbionts of sap-feeding insects are extreme exemplars of this relationship: Carsonella ruddii [5], Sulcia muelleri [6], and Buchnera aphidicola Cc [7], which represent three independently evolved endosymbiont lineages, have the smallest and most GC-poor genomes yet reported (Figure 1). These bacteria have a strict intracellular lifestyle, and this shift from a free-living state to an obligate intracellular one greatly reduces the effective population size of the bacteria, in part by exposing them to frequent population bottlenecks as they are maternally transmitted during the insect lifecycle [2],[3],[8]. This population structure leads to an increase in genetic drift, and this increase, combined with the constant availability of the rich metabolite pool of the insect host cell, is thought to explain the massive gene loss and high rate of sequence evolution seen in intracellular bacteria [2],[3]. Sequence evolution is also likely accelerated by an increased mutation rate, stemming from the loss of genes involved in DNA repair during genome reduction [4]. This loss of repair enzymes may contribute to the AT bias of small bacterial genomes since common chemical changes in DNA, cytosine deaminations and guanosine oxidations, both lead to mutations in which an AT pair replaces a GC pair, if left unrepaired [9],[10]. Indeed, the properties of all symbiont genomes published to date fit well within this framework (Figure 1).
The UGA Stop→Trp recoding, found in the mycoplasmas and several mitochondrial lineages, is associated with both genome reduction and low GC content [11]–[13]. Under the “codon capture” model, a codon falls to low frequency and is then free to be reassigned without major fitness repercussions. Applying this model to the UGA Stop→Trp recoding, mutational bias towards AT causes each UGA to mutate to the synonym UAA without affecting protein length [14],[15]. When the UGA codon subsequently reappears through mutation, it is then free to code for an amino acid [14],[15]. While some have argued that codon capture is insufficient to explain many recoding events [11],[12], the fact that all known UGA Stop→Trp recodings have taken place in high AT genomes [11],[16] makes the argument attractive for this recoding.
Here we describe the genomic properties of an α-Proteobacterial symbiont (for which we propose the name Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola) from the cicada Diceroprocta semicincta (Davis 1928) [17]. We show that at only 143,795 bps it has the smallest known cellular genome, but has a high GC content of 58.4% and a recoding of UGA Stop→Trp. We hypothesize that gene loss associated with genome reduction is a critical step in this recoding, rather than mutational pressure favoring AT. Specifically, we suggest that loss of translational release factor RF2, which recognizes the UGA stop, was the unifying force driving the recoding in Hodgkinia as well as in certain other small AT-rich genomes.
