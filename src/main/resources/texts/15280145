We can't honestly say we've ever had a flash drive go bad because it wasn't tough enough, but apparently there's a market of globe-trotting ex-military jungle assassins out there big enough for Verbatim to join in with the Tuff-Clip USB stick. (Actually, it's TUFF-CLIP, because all-caps names are water-resistant to 100 feet.) Of course, you'll have to pay for those rugged good looks: the 4GB version is $30, while the 8GB is $50. Not exactly a steal when you consider this Hello Kitty stick we've been using cost us nothing more than our pride.Filed under: StorageVerbatim Tuff-Clip flash drives for the adventure nerd originally appeared on Engadget on Mon, 10 Aug 2009 19:58:00 EST.
