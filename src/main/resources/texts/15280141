Well, it looks like folks in search of an alternative to Viliv's S5 MID now have another option -- in China, at least, where Tainell has just rolled out its new T500 handheld. Like the S5, this one packs a 5-inch display and the usual Atom Z510 processor, along with some decent enough specs all around, including 1GB of RAM, a 32GB SSD, a built-in webcam, integrated Bluetooth, GPS, and 3G, and Windows XP for an OS. No word on a price just yet, unfortunately, let alone any indication of a release outside of China.
