What are 'Ads by Google'?
We're glad you asked. 'Ads by Google' are ads that connect people to information about products and services that are relevant to the content they're reading. Google technology understands the nuances of language, and closely matches (or "targets") ads to the specific content.
The publishers who display Google ads in their feeds are part of Google AdSense and participating in the AdSense for feeds program. The ads are from Google's base of AdWords advertisers. These advertisers and publishers range from global corporations to small local businesses.
