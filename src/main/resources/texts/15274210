The plane was neither was very old nor in bad working condition at all as per reports. It is also reported that the plane had a range of 200 to 300 miles and carried 15 gallons of gasoline. Therefore till the further investigation, nothing could be declared as the cause of accident.
Initial reports say that Edward E. Toth had flown from Dulles International Airport. One of his old friends Mr. Howard Patterson, who is a retired aircraft engineer too, informed that there were pontoons on the plane so had he got enough time, Toth could have landed on water safely.
Till the last reports, the 17-years injured girl was being taken care of at Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg.
