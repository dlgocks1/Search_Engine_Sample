creativity + poken = awesome!
some of you have been posting your custom poken cards online.  this is COOL.
my  favourite collection right now is called Festival Kids by a bunch of Japanese cool kids. they’ve created an entire series of classic, degital, analog, photo, and minimal designs to download. yay!
the festival kids even created a Photo ID maker so you can easily add your photo to one of their amazing cards. here is a taster…

Pokendesign.com is a German community site that emulates Threadless (well, kinda). you can upload your own designs and vote on favourites. it even includes an explanation of how to change your card (in German but pretty visual). nice work Mission Poken.
