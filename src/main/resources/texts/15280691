Check out the PedalPower+ system for bicycles that is able to take whatever power generated by an AC dynamo, changing it into a DC source which can be used safely by plugging in other electronic devices including MP3 players and cellphones. This is a long awaited peripheral considering how the dynamo was used to power the bicycle's light in the older years, and equipment used on a bicycle has become so much more complicated and advanced over the years. The PedalPower+ system relies on a bottle dynamo or hub dynamo, depending on your preference. The latter will require some fair bit of modification as well as a re-spoking. Charging on the go has just gotten yet another champion with the PedalPower+ system.
