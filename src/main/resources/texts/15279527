Dane Cook was holding the stage to present the Choice Hotties award. Vanessa Hudgens was among the nominees for the same.
Dane Cook searched for Vanessa and she may be felt overjoyed so she waived hands to the teen fans all around. Dane first commented, “Before I do the Choice Hotties, can I just say what everybody in the room is thinking but nobody has said?”
She felt completely off guard when Dane Cook stunned the poor girl in front of millions of viewers, by his comic remarks that followed: “Girl, you got to keep your clothes on! Phones are for phone calls, girl!” Ah. Just fee the agony Vanessa Hudgens must have gone through.
She did not seem to enjoy rather people could only see a pain stricken face. Dane succeeded, the audience laughed. But at the same time, plenty of people hissed and booed at Dane. Dane then gave the award to the winner, Megan Fox.
It has been reported that Dane has completely refused to offer any apologies as he admits, it was all pre-planned. He said, “I planned it about 20 minutes before I went out there. I said it because I like to be on the cusp of fear.”
He insisted to state the he was the bravest person to ‘broach a subject that nobody else dared bring up.’ “Mostly I just wanted it to be funny.” That’s the best part about being a comic, when you go, ‘Maybe I can say the thing that everybody is kind of feeling and nobody is saying.’
Here is a photo of Dane Cook and a Vanessa Hudgens as well.
