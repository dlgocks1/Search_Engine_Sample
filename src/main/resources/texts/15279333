Based on Gothic type and late medieval calligraphy, these styles range from those marking the beginning of Gothic printing to the ornate Gothic types of 19th century Germany. This category also includes faces with a Gothic look but created by modern type designers. 
Blackletter types include the ß character and ligatures (ch, sch, tz, etc.) and therefore have a narrower character width than roman style types. Our selection includes types in the Old English as well as blackletter styles.

Traditional blackletter types bring to mind knights and ladies and jousts and castles and are unmistakably associated with the Middle Ages. Today they are used in a variety of applications, in headlines, logos, signs, fantasy games, movies and much more. The word Gothic suggests a dark, mystical atmosphere, making these fonts a good choice for anything from Halloween invitations to Gothic-style graphic design to CD labels and posters.
