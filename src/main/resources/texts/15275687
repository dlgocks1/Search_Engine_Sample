The rescue crews successfully ‘freed’ 24 sufferers hung up on “Invertigo” ride for nearly 4 hours.
It has been reported that the Roller Coaster called “The Invertigo” faced a mechanical failure which resulted in trapping 24 thrill seekers in a fearful and frightening manner until the firefighters reached and used their skills to safely offload the death flight’s passengers. Thanks heavens, there were no injuries reported in this particular incident.
The scene created there is pretty simple to describe verbally but it was not that easy at all to bear all the fear, tension plus the scorching heat all together for 4 long hours. What happened was the extremely high-speed roller coaster Invertigo came to a halt at once at ascent to the top of the ride. Just imagine how it feels when we are stuck in an awkward position as high as 80 feet in the air!
The riders there were screaming and yelling with fear as they were strapped helplessly in their seats with legs dangling in the air and they feared as to when their holdings may give in and…
The firefighters used their basket-topped ladders to reach the troubled and one after another, the riders reached the ground safely and I am sure, many of them might have cursed themselves to decide to have fun.
Meanwhile the investigations have already started to determine the reason of the sudden disorder of the machine as it almost killed 24 aboard.
