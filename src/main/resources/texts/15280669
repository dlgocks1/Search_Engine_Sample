It goes without saying that making good, proper use of a crutch right after an operation is essential to be on the complete road of recovery, and a physiotherapist and a computer scientist from the University of Southampton believes in that ideal so much so that they have developed an intelligent crutch. This invention of theirs comes with force sensors and accelerometers, where the crutch is smart enough to furnish information based on its own movement while calculating the maount of pressure applied to the leg. This information will then be processed before the user is greeted with a visual cue as to whether they are using the crutch properly or not.
