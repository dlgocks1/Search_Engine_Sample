For the better part of a decade, the Research Library has provided
public access to online versions of the Numerical Recipes books,
with permission of the authors and publisher.
The authors are now able to provide access from their own website at
http://www.nrbook.com, and
in partnership with their publisher, Cambridge University
Press, plan to introduce paid value-added services.
LANL staff will continue to have access to the
local copy
of the books. New editions will only be available at
http://www.nrbook.com.
