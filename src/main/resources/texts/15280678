The upcoming Samsung SGH-A797 from AT&T was recently caught in the wild, and it seems pretty clear that this will be yet another touchscreen capable handset to hit the market, accompanied by a sliding QWERTY keyboard to help those who want to compose text messages and email in a jiffy. Other features include Bluetooth connectivity and MP3 playback support. No idea on the official pricing, but it seems that the phone is already available over at Craigslist for a relatively affordable $115. Let's just wait for the official announcement from AT&T for further details.
