Michael Ancram, the former Conservative party chairman, is standing down at the next election, it was announced today.Ancram, 64, told Tories in his Devizes constituency in Wiltshire that he was leaving parliament for health reasons. The Conservative association in Devizes issued a statement saying his decision was "greeted with a combination of concern at the cause of his decision and great pride and respect at the way he has served the Devizes constituency since first elected in 1992".In a letter to the chairman of his constituency party, he said he had been taking medication for a heart problem for the last six years.Ancram achieved prominence as chairman of the Tory party when William Hague was leader and as deputy leader and shadow foreign secretary from 2001 to 2005.But he was probably at his most influential as a Northern Ireland minister in John Major's government from 1993 to 1997. Ancram was responsible for political developments following the IRA ceasefire and he played a major role in initiating the talks process that eventually led, after Labour's election victory, to the Good Friday agreement in 1998.Ancram is the 13th Marquess of Lothian, although he does not use his title in his political life. But, like some other Tory grandees, he is thought to have been unhappy with the hardline stance taken by David Cameron over MPs' expenses.He was criticised for charging the taxpayer for repairs to a swimming pool and he agreed to repay around Â£98.58 to cover the cost.In a statement announcing his decision, Ancram said: It is with genuine sadness that I have decided to stand down from parliament at the coming general election. This decision has been forced upon me by considerations of health."I have for the past six years successfully been on medication for coronary problems. I have however recently had to consider the effects of the pressures of another five years of parliamentary and constituency duties upon my health."I have also taken into consideration the fact that I will be almost 65 at the time when the election is likely to be held. I have reluctantly concluded that for the sake of my family and myself the time has come for me to stand down."A barrister and QC, Ancram represented Berwickshire and East Lothian between February and October 1974 and Edinburgh South from 1979 to 1987.At Devizes he had a majority of 13,194 at the last election.
