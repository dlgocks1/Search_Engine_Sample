We’ve got a hands-on with the Zune coming up shortly, but we thought you should all know that pricing has indeed been leaked on Microsoft’s sexy new player. At $220 and $290 for 16GB and 32GB respectively, they’re exactly in line with what I expected (I flatter myself shamelessly but it’s true) an a little lower than rumors had it.
This anticipates the expected price drop from Apple coming this fall. A microphone and camera (not to mention the App Store) on the iPod Touch still set it apart, though.
