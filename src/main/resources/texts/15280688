The folks at ColorWare has done their bit to expand the love of colors to the BlackBerry Tour, and this is pretty speedy considering the smartphone didn't even make it out for more than a month already. ColorWare is willing to take your Tour and give you a custom color coating of your choice for $129, while you can pick up a customized design from them directly for $750, with an unlocked Tour in tow. As usual, you can have a myriad of choices to go nuts over, while letting various parts get accentted by a color of your preference.
