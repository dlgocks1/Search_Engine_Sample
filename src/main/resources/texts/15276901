Mr Blacks Picture Post
I have just inherited my uncle Oscar's estate and in the process of sorting his effects came across a humongous collection of the prints and Polaroids of his secret photography hobby. It has put me in mind to not only share these with you but also to expose you to some of Mr Black's vast collection of ephemera and art. So do click here and pop over for a snoop around. Mr Black's Picture Post Do join the blog and I will post more soon.

Mr Black is somewhat notoriouse in France and the recent shoot in the Paris apartment to show of the cool style and new art for Elle Decoration (France) will do nothing to diminish this standing. Yes you are quite right they do referre to me is Monsiour Noir et ses petites filles. Cynthia came over on the Eurostar with me from Oxford for the weekend to provide the bound eye candy model for the shoot as she likes to purr 'ses petites filles' and then all demure and breathless which I can never resist 'puis-je avoir un nouveau costume' So yes a little shopping before, during and after. Oh i do like to spoil my girls, well they do spoil me. The occassion was to celebrate some new silk screen prints Kinky Jimmy the illustrator has produced by way of a little private commision pour moi. See below for some samples - The French love them and call them 'fillette noire indulgence'

Kissing Mr Blacks Ring
Now there seems to be a lot of hysterical gurly chatter going on about kissing Mr Black's ring, and while I am sure this is some sort of euphemistic gurly thing and not being up on all this gossipy banter I will consider it in the catholic sense. So while I am flattered that you put me on high with a Papal respect and I while am guilty of an indulgent Roman period (That's another story). I do find that his holiness's dress does not suit me, neither does his little hat, or the propensity to wear white. However all of this aside and in my usual generous manner I would still like to offer you gurls my ring for your adoration.

Pants to you Mr Black 2
Following on from my entry below Prodigious Mr Black Well yes I have been busy on your behalf, deep in conversation with my British manufacturers. As some of you will know the issue of staff uniforms for my novices on the Nymphet training program has been a constant point of dishevelment for me. A clearly defined set of uniforms is so important for you girls. It gives you focus, the confidence to attain your desires, a sense of responsibility and an instant realisation of your role and sense of subservience to my approaches and whims. The training panties model No2 is currently undergoing trials at Blacklands as we speak and very promising they are turning out to be. Not for the junior novice who will start on Training Panties model No1 (see below), this is for someone who has already reached some of the accolade levels in the training program and has graduated to a more meaningful role, such as hand maiden or chambermaid. Modeled her by Alice who is currently a senior novice and following her recent physical assimilation will graduate as a complete Nymphet shortly. Mr Black has combined the finest features of full panties, girdle styling and corsalet lacing to create this fine garment that takes more than a small page from the wonderful Fredrick's of Hollywood. Sheer and sateen panels encase the derriere with the lacing pulling the cheeks together tightly to master that so aspired peach cheek appearance. Six suspender straps will hold the obligatory stockings firmly in place and while they are adjustable they should be worn as high as possible. The stretch sateen panels which are finished in a fine lace design, provide padding and support on the sides to achieve those slim but gorgeous gurly hips while on the front the panel will clinch and trap your little clitty to stop it from inadvertently misbehaving. Only available in white Do let me know what you think of this design.

Pants to you Mr Black 1
So many of you indecisive gurls ask me "What should I wear to please you Mr Black?" While there is no end to the flimsy and frilly dainties out there that will slip up and over your delicate little hairless forms, there is nothing that really fits the bill for a good training session. So to that end Mr Black has been ceaselessly searching on your behalf a positively Grail-esque quest, which has proved to no avail. Fortunately for you Mr Black has brought his enormous and respected creative prows to bear on the problem and has designed some garments with you in mind. A garment that is both decorative and functional that draws on Mr Blacks prodigious experience of taking in hand the transformation and discipline of unruly little nymphets like you. It is proving a wow with my little pack of novices who in these early trials at Blacklands. Designed specifically for novices who are still on the first rungs of the long ladder to achieving the dizzy heights of becoming a full, complete, Nymphet. Sheer stretch sateen gives a smooth and strokable finish while a high waisted cut helps you to achieve that neat trim tummy Mr Black so insists on. Elasticated legs to keep all your gurly clitty bits tucked away in a neat and restrained manner. And the pièce de résistance the open derriere a master stroke of engineering, the tight elasticated edges draw your pert cheeks in and up to achieve that desired peachy quality while the exposure keeps them cool and accessible for taking in hand. The elastication here is not so restrictive as to deny access to your most intimate and inner gurly lips for administration with tools and implements or on occasion delivering a passionate and deep personal reward. All of this is topped of with a jaunty and delightfully delicate little satin bow. Currently only available in Black (naturally)

Cum Fairy
I cast a spell on you Well it would appear I have a CUM fairy and I feel sure this one cums and cums again. Well a dainty little thing she is and I can just see her now impaled atop of the very pinnacle of my christmas tree in the drawing room of Blacklands in Oxfordshire later this year. Mr Black does enjoy having a very big tree so we hope this fairy has been suitable trained. Speaking of which and judging by the mail I have been receiving it would appear allot of you desire some of the firm training that we employ at Blacklands. Is that so?

Miss Bianca Black
What should I do? It is so easily done these days, you can suddenly find the most charming people on line. Mr Black would like to introduce you to the supremely elegant and stylish, perfectly hosed, permanently lingeried, totally stilettoed and delightfully dolly Miss Bianca Black. As your master is of course an only child we are not related although she could be a long lost twin sister. However the prospect of this does not stop her from making overtures towards yours truly, it is a little more than sibling compasion I fancy she has on her mind. So please advise me what you think I should do? Do visit her website, to see much, much more of the minx Mr Black affectionately calls Miss Bianca Black. CLICK HERE
