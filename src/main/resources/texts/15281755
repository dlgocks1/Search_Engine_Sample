Hi guys! I'm so excited for this blog! I can't wait to share a little bit of my life with you. It can get a little crazy sometimes, but I've learned to roll with it.. 
My life in a nutshell: 
I was born in Illinois 21 years ago, but moved to Europe shortly after, and lived in England for 9 years before moving back to the States. I grew up in a tiny town in Florida called Niceville (believe it or not!) I don't really know how to explain Niceville.. The entire town is connected by one road, everybody knows everybody, and if you don't get out, you'll wind up married with a baby by the time you graduate high school. So after dating a guy for over 4 years I realized I was heading down the same path and decided to run away to Miami to give modeling a shot. After a while I'd decided to get more serious with modeling, so I decided to move to LA. You may know me as an Octagon Girl from the UFC, but that is only a very small part of my life..
More to come!
