GOOGLE HAS TRIED to steal thunder from the Microsoft Yahoo search deal by releasing a sandbox preview of its new search engine.
The engine is supposed to be faster, better and bring peace in our time. It is here and frankly we played around with it a little and got identical search results from the normal Google search.
How fast does a search engine have to be? It always seemed to be the same speed as downloading a page and this version does not seem to be noticably quicker.
However that has not stopped some press in this silly late summer season from describing this as Google having "dropped a bomb on would-be search challengers such as Microsoft, Yahoo and Facebook".
The sandbox is apparently the work of a quack team of Googlers who have been beavering away in secret. Apparently the new infrastructure sits "under the hood" of Google's search engine, which we think means that most users won't notice a difference in search results.
According to Google it is really web developers and "power searchers" who might notice a few differences.
So, lets see, a new search engine that you claim is faster and better but no one will notice the difference? Yup, that will have Microsoft quaking with fear.
Could this be a case of Emperior's new clothes? Looks the same, does the same things, and Google says we will not notice the difference. I would not go out into the street wearing that.
But go ahead, play with it and let Google know what you think. Âµ
