There have been appeals for no retaliation after pitches belonging to a GAA 
club were daubed with sectarian slogans.
Vandals used weedkiller to write slogans on two football pitches belonging to 
the Augher St McCartanâ€™s club in Co Tyrone.
No-one from the club was prepared to comment when contacted yesterday.
The vandalism, which is believed to have occurred during the last week, has 
led to fears of a renewed outbreak of attacks on community premises.
Last November three Orange halls and two GAA clubs were attacked within the 
space of a fortnight in the east of the county.
Spokesman for the Tyrone County GAA Board Damian Harvey described the attack 
as a pointless act and called for no retaliation.
Tom Elliott, an Ulster Unionist MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said those 
responsible would only raise tension in the area.
