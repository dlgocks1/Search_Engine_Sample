I wanted to contribute to the design of daily  domestic noises. alarms, mobile phones, a doorbell; he is of the opinion  that not enough thought has been given to the noises they produce. The musical  kettle is a part of series 're-design soundscape'. As the kettle boils it  whistles your favorite tune.
