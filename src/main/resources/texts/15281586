The addition he made introduced a new option: to define how many posts are displayed on a tag archive page - if the Ultimate Tag Warrior plugin was installed and the posts were tagged.
That CQS plugin stopped working with WordPress 2.3 where the the whole category system has been reworked. The UTW plugin also became obsolete since in this version the developers introduced WP’s own tagging system.
I messed around a bit with the code and finally came up with a version that is using the new tagging system of WordPress to define how many posts to be displayed on a ‘tag archive page’.
You can set the number of posts for a lot of different “views” (archives, month, categories, categories by name, home, search etc.). For the options that you will not set your custom number of posts - the number set in the Options > Reading will be inherited.
The plugin has been tested with the Default and the Classic theme on WP 2.3 and 2.3.1 installations. 
Download and enjoy! 
P.S. Please, report back, comment below if you notice any bug or experience difficulties with the plugin. Although I am not a pro coder I will try to offer limited support.
