Memberships for PACE® and Health Care Services Programs
NPA offers a seamless array of membership services that meet the varied and changing needs of an organization as it progresses from consideration of the PACE model to on-going, full operational status. 
Exploring PACE Membership.   An Exploring PACE membership will assist you in assessing whether PACE development is the right strategic decision for your organization, today and in the future.
Prospective Provider Membership.   Once you have made the decision to pursue PACE development, a Prospective Provider membership will assist you in developing a PACE program and completing the PACE provider application.
Provider Membership.   Fully operational PACE programs face many on-going challenges from both an operational perspective and in complying with ever-changing regulatory requirements.  A Provider membership provides targeted services to assist you in improving your operations and pro-actively identifying and complying with Federal regulations that uniquely impact PACE programs.
Capitated Provider Membership.   A Capitated Provider membership provides targeted services to health care providers operating with capitated payments in order to assist them in operating a successful program.
Memberships for Technical Assistance Centers
Technical Assistance Center (TAC) Memberships.  A Technical Assistance Center (TAC) membership provides TACs with knowledge, information and tools they can use in providing expertise and guidance to organizations that are exploring, developing, operating or expanding PACE programs. 
Memberships for Allied Organizations
Associate Membership.   Organizations that do not meet the qualifications for one of the memberships listed above, but that share a vision and dedication to providing innovative care for older adults benefit from an Associate membership by keeping abreast of emerging trends and issues impacting PACE.
