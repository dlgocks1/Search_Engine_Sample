How much more could you get done if you completed all of your required reading in 1/3 or 1/5 the time?
Increasing reading speed is a process of controlling fine motor movement—period.
This post is a condensed overview of principles I taught to undergraduates at Princeton University in 1998 at a seminar called the “PX Project”. The below was written several years ago, so it’s worded like Ivy-Leaguer pompous-ass prose, but the results are substantial. In fact, while on an airplane in China two weeks ago, I helped Glenn McElhose increase his reading speed 34% in less than 5 minutes. I have never seen the method fail. Here’s how it works…
Four Hour Week
Derren Fact: DB can read at speeds of over 65,000 words per minute with the right book, a very strong coffee and with a recall rate of just over 94%. However after 5-6 minutes he starts emitting smoke from his ears and always states that he does not enjoy it.
