Nigerian Amnesty Plan Faces Difficulties

DAKAR, Senegal  A new peace effort in one of Africa’s most strategic yet troubled regions, Nigeria’s Niger Delta, is being greeted with weary skepticism by experts and citizens who have been caught up in years of violence and other failed attempts to end the conflict. The Nigerian government, beleaguered by unrest in both the north and south, is trying to quell the southern violence with an amnesty program for militants. For years, fighters demanding a greater share of the region’s wealth have been sabotaging the country’s oil industry, one of the United States’ biggest suppliers, with brazen attacks on pipelines, oil depots and kidnappings of industry workers. The government began its 60-day amnesty offer last Thursday for any fighter willing to come out of the region’s million-square-mile network of oil-laden creeks and swamps, turn in his weapon and accept a $13 daily stipend in exchange. Around 8,000 to 10,000 fighters could take up the offer, officials say. The government insists the program is already “right on track,” in the words of a spokesperson, but difficulties emerged immediately. One main militant group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, has continued attacks. There is a visible lack of activity at government arms-collection centers. And perhaps most important, there is a broad sentiment that the Niger Delta’s deep-seated problems of poverty, corruption and pollution are going unaddressed. At several would-be arms depots over the weekend in Bayelsa and Delta States, no militants were stepping forward to turn in their guns, leaving the security agents to sit around waiting. Notwithstanding a ceremonious meeting between President Umaru Yar’Adua and 32 militant leaders Friday in the Nigerian capital, Abuja  they lined up to shake his hand  experts predicted that the new peace program was unlikely to have much impact on the sabotage campaign that helped cut Nigerian oil production over 40 percent between 2006 and March of this year. “I don’t think the amnesty as proposed will have the capacity to end violence in the Niger Delta,” said Dr. Sam Amadi, who was a member of the special government committee set up to study the region’s problems. “It’s credible to think that after a normal lull there will be a resurgence,” he said. “The fundamental issues of equity and democratization that are driving the activity, there are no serious or effective proposals under way to deal with this.” Even Henry Okah, who has long been considered a MEND leader and was released from prison last month in what seemed a test run of the amnesty deal, denied that the effort would work. “How many weapons have been recovered?” Mr. Okah said in a telephone interview. “What makes it a success? Where are the weapons? I think it’s all just a joke.”The outcome is of far more than academic interest to the United States. West Africa was supplying about 15 percent of daily oil imports by the middle of this decade, and Nigeria, as the world’s 11th largest producer, was by far the biggest regional source, according to a 2007 paper in International Policy Report by three American experts. Little of that wealth has made it down to the Delta, however. The same experts cited figures showing that 80 percent of oil money goes to 1 percent of the Nigerian population. Meanwhile the Delta remains destitute even by Nigerian standards, with one doctor for every 150,000 inhabitants in Bayelsa and Delta, and pervasive “social deprivation, abject poverty, filth and squalor,” according to the United Nations Development Program. “The situation is terribly deplorable in terms of infrastructure, poverty, wants, and environmental pollution,” said Dr. Youpele Banigo, who was also a member of the government study committee. “The Niger Delta fighters are not fighting for an amnesty,” said Mr. Okah. “They’re fighting to address the conditions to which the people of the Niger Delta have been subjected to for 50 years.”The combination of wealthy foreign oil companies, entrenched poverty and ideal terrain for guerrilla warfare has produced a state of semi-conflict for much of the decade, with routine confrontations between armed groups  some with political agendas, others simply out for personal gain  and government troops. There were 92 attacks on the oil industry in 2008, up a third from the previous year; 1,000 people killed in the first nine months of last year; and over 128 people kidnapped between January 2008 and April 2009, according to the International Crisis Group. In May, the Nigerian military sought to crush the militants with firepower, as it has in the past, at one point using helicopters with machine guns on a village where a festival was taking place, according to Amnesty International; hundreds were believed to have been killed and wounded in the assaults, including women and children, Amnesty said.But as in the past, the military campaign appeared to have little effect. In July, militants managed to strike outside the Niger Delta as well, setting fire to an oil depot and tankers in the country’s economic center, Lagos. The attack took place after the announcement of the amnesty program, underscoring the low esteem in which militants’ appeared to hold the government efforts. A government spokesperson, Timiebi Koripamo-Agary, insisted that the amnesty was a move in the right direction. “We know that amnesty alone can’t solve the problem,” said Ms. Koripamo-Agary.Outside the government, though, there is skepticism. “The money realized will be used to rearm,” said Anyakwee Nsirimovu, chairman of the Niger Delta Civil Society Coalition. “Criminals who claim to be militants will come forward and take the amnesty, and that will be delaying doomsday. As long as the equity situation is not solved, you will continue to have people who will blow up pipelines.” Senan Murray contributed reporting from Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
