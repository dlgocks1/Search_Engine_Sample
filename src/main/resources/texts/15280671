Stealth Computer has released its latest NW-2000 notebook which is actually a pretty tough hybrid notebook/tablet that will be powered by Intelâ€™s 1.06GHz Core 2 Duo. It complies with the MIL-STD-810F standard that enables shock and vibration compliance, featuring a 13.3" sunlight viewable resistive touchscreen display, 2GB RAM, a 160GB shock-mounted hard-drive or optional SSD and a spill-resistant keyboard. Apart from that, connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and gigabit Ethernet. Don't expect this to come cheap though as the Stealth NW-2000 will retail from $4,895 upwards.
