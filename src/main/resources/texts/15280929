Putting a fart app on your iPhone does not turn the faceless gadget into a unique signifier of your individuality.
For true phone freaks, nothing tops a vintage novelty squawk box for making the kind of ringing statement that cannot be ignored, even at 20 feet. Just don't try slipping one of these bad boys into your pocket: While most modern phones look almost antiseptically sleek, yesteryear's weirdo handsets came in a wide variety of bold colors and unwieldy form factors.
Janet Lavelle, who runs the Antique Radio Museum in Oak Forest, Illinois, also collects vintage phones. She showed Wired.com her collection, the dozens of phones she's picked up at garage sales and thrift stores. Most are modeled on characters from comic strips and TV shows, although some are even weirder than that.
Got a vintage phone of your own? Send us a photo, and we'll share it with the world.
