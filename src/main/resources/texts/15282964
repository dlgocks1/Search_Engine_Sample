Some
people
complained about the insane memory usage of firefox.
It must be a misunderstanding. They probably are not aware of how to trigger
the excellent garbage collector shipped with the browser.
Let's navigate heavily a bit, opening several new tabs, click click click
around, then closing those tabs:
$ top -b -n 1 | egrep "firefox|PID"
PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND
6842 enrico 20 0 882m 398m 17m S 2 19.9 24:29.55 firefox-bin
Indeed Firefox memory usage quickly grew. I've seen it grow to a gigabyte and a
half after keeping it open for a month.
Now let's trigger the garbage collector:
$ kill -9 6842
$ # Rerun firefox
$ # Click on "Restore previous session"
$ # Wait for the various open tabs to reload
And voil√†! Now Firefox uses much less memory than before:
$ top -b -n 1 | egrep "firefox|PID"
PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND
5242 enrico 20 0 656m 205m 25m S 0 10.3 0:14.49 firefox-bin
