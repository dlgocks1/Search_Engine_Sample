Back in June it was rumored that the HTC Hero was being tested within the wireless carrier Sprint, and could be ready for release by the end of the year. Well, Engadget have recently discovered a page on the official HTC website that pretty much confirms that rumor.
An official support page has been discovered on the HTC Hero website that reveals Sprint will be the carrier of choice for the HTC Hero device.
It is not yet known whether the CDMA version HTC Hero will affect the availability of the unlocked US 3G version, but it does seem likely that Sprint will want some level of exclusivity for the device.
A release date for the HTC Hero on Sprint has not yet been revealed, although the handset is expected to be released by the end of the year.
