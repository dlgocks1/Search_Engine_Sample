I couldn't really find a skin that I liked so I decided to make a quick one. I like having the artwork displayed on my other monitor so I like to have it bigger than most. The artwork is 200x200px so it is pretty large. It's really just an edit of Platitude, but I figured I would share since there doesn't seem to be a lot of skins for this app. I probably won't update it unless there is something that must be changed. Controls come up on hover like Platitude. Enjoy! Download
