The Sony Ericsson T715a has recently passed stringent FCC tests, edging this GSM 850/1900 and UMTS 850/1900 handset closer to a release by all standards. Just in case those bands seem familiar to you, they're the same as the ones AT&T uses, which points toward yet another future phone release from the mobile carrier in the near future. Just to recap your memory, the T715a will also be equipped with a 2.2" QVGA display, Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity, an integrated stereo FM radio, a 3.2-megapixel camera, 90MB of internal memory, a microSD memory card slot and Google Maps support.
