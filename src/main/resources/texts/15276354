waited till 1: 30 last night only for those three minutes...
it's a very annoying pseudo-intellectual tv show btw, and pj's presence at the end ----after 1 hour 40 minutes blablabla ---- made me realise even more deeply how much courage and purity it demands to create music like this, in this crappy artificial world that we live in.
what a performance! speechless...

to watch this performance, it's the same show but has a much better quality than the vid i posted, you have to install the DivX webplayer but it's worth it
