Set Fill Mode for Writes
These calls are intended for advanced usage, to optimize writes under
some circumstances described below. The function ncsetfill (or
NCSFIL for FORTRAN) sets the fill mode for an netCDF file
open for writing and returns the current fill mode. The fill mode can
be specified as either NC_FILL or NC_NOFILL (NCFILL
or NCNOFILL for FORTRAN). The default behavior corresponding to
NC_FILL is that data is pre-filled with fill values, that is fill
values are written when you create non-record variables or when you
write a value beyond data that hasn't been written yet. This makes it
possible to detect attempts to read data before it was written.
See section Missing Values, for more information on the use of fill values.
See section Attribute Conventions for information about how to define your
own fill values.
The behavior corresponding to NC_NOFILL overrides the default
behavior of prefilling data with fill values. This can be used to
enhance performance, because it avoids the duplicate writes that occur
when the netCDF library writes fill values that are immediately
overwritten with data.
A value indicating which mode the netCDF file was already in is
returned. You can use this value to temporarily change the fill mode of
an open netCDF file and then restore it to the previous mode.
After you turn on NC_NOFILL mode for an open netCDF file, you
must be certain to write valid data in all the positions that will later
be read. Note that NC_NOFILL mode is only a transient property
of a netCDF file open for writing: if you close and reopen the file, it
will revert to the default behavior. You can also revert to the default
behavior by calling ncsetfill (or NCSFIL for FORTRAN)
again to explicitly set the fill mode to NC_FILL.
There are three situations where it is advantageous to set nofill mode:
Creating and initializing a netCDF file. In this case, you should set
nofill mode before calling ncendef (NCENDF for FORTRAN),
and then write completely all non-record variables and the
initial records of all the record variables you want to initialize.
Extending an existing record-oriented netCDF file. Set nofill mode
after opening the file for writing, then append the additional records
to the file completely, leaving no intervening unwritten records.
Adding new variables that you are going to initialize to an existing
netCDF file. Set nofill mode before calling ncendef
(NCENDF for FORTRAN), then write all the new variables
completely.
If the netCDF file has an unlimited dimension and the last record was
written while in NC_NOFILL mode, then the file will be 4 bytes
longer than if NC_NOFILL mode wasn't set, but this will be
completely transparent if you access the data only through the netCDF
interfaces.
In case of an error, ncsetfill returns -1; NCSFIL returns a
nonzero value in rcode. Possible causes of errors include:
The specified netCDF ID does not refer to an open netCDF file.
The specified netCDF ID refers to a file open for read-only access.
The fillmode argument is neither NC_NOFILL nor NC_FILL
(neither NCNOFILL nor NCFILL for FORTRAN).
ncsetfill: C Interface
int ncsetfill(int ncid, int fillmode);
ncid
NetCDF ID, returned from a previous call to ncopen or nccreate.
fillmode
Desired fill mode for the file, either NC_NOFILL or
NC_FILL.
ncsetfill
Returns the current fill mode of the file before this call, either
NC_NOFILL or NC_FILL.
Here is an example using ncsetfill to set nofill mode for
subsequent writes of a netCDF file named `foo.nc':
#include "netcdf.h"
...
int ncid;
...
ncid = ncopen("foo.nc", NC_WRITE); /* open for writing */
... /* write data with default prefilling behavior */
ncsetfill(ncid, NC_NOFILL); /* set nofill mode */
... /* write data with no prefilling */
NCSFIL: FORTRAN Interface
INTEGER FUNCTION NCSFIL(INTEGER NCID, INTEGER FILLMODE,
+ INTEGER RCODE)
NCID
NetCDF ID, returned from a previous call to NCOPN or NCCRE.
FILLMODE
Desired fill mode for the file, either NCNOFILL or
NCFILL.
RCODE
Returned error code. If no errors occurred, 0 is returned.
NCSFIL
Returns the current fill mode of the file before this call, either
NCNOFILL or NCFILL.
Here is an example using NCSFIL to set nofill mode for
a netCDF file named `foo.nc':
INCLUDE 'netcdf.inc'
...
INTEGER NCID, RCODE, OMODE
...
NCID = NCOPN('foo.nc', NCWRITE, RCODE)
...
* write data with default prefilling behavior
...
OMODE = NCSFIL(NCID, NCNOFILL, RCODE)
...
* write data with no prefilling
...
