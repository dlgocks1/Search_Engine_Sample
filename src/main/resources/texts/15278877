The Arcade Flyer Archive (TAFA) is a digital repository for advertisement flyers that are used by the coin-operated amusement industry to promote the sales of its games. Flyers are still used today and over time they represent much more than a printed brochure. They capture a unique blend of the industry's history, graphic design trends, advertising campaigns and most importantly the endless nostalgia of millions of people who are taken in by the culture of video games, pinball machines and arcade games. Cabinet designs, attractive artwork and screenshots, all of which represent the visual language of coin-op games make flyers effective research tools for collectors who seek to restore their equipment to their original factory specifications. Flash back to the games you grew up with and be wowed by the games you never saw in the wild. Remember the games. Feel the nostalgia. We hope you enjoy The Arcade Flyer Archive as much as we do. And thanks for visiting! TAFA is also the home to Mame Flyerpacks, which are the video game flyer images that go with selected Mame front end applications.Marine Date
