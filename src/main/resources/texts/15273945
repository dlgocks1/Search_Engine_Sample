A strong earthquake struck Shizuoka Prefecture west of Tokyo early Tuesday morning, jolting wide parts of Japan's main island. The earthquake hit at 5:07 AM local time. Japan's Meteorological Agency says the quake registered a Magnitude of 6.5, with its focus in Suruga Bay at a depth of 23 kilometers. Tremors with an intensity of 6 minus on the Japanese scale of 0 to 7 were registered in 4 cities in Shizuoka Prefecture. The cities are Izu, Yaizu, Makinohara and Omaezaki. According to the Meteorological Agency, jolts with an intensity of 6 minus can move furniture, and shatter walls and windows. It can also be difficult for people to stand upright. Tremors with a lesser intensity of 4 were felt in parts of Tokyo, Yokohama, and in the prefectures of Yamanashi, Nagano and Aichi. Minutes after the earthquake, the Meteorological Agency issued tsunami advisories, and tidal surges of up to 60 centimeters were observed off Shizuoka Prefecture. The waves later subsided, and advisories were lifted shortly after 7 AM.
