Pre-orders are now being accepted for OpenBSD 4.6, scheduled for release on October 1st, 2009.
The developers bring us an amazing amount of cool new stuff (PF now enabled by default, a new privilege-separated SMTP daemon, routing domain support and lots more).
Of course, t-shirts and posters are available too. Order your set NOW!
