Guys. We need to make a logo for the new Microsoft stores. Yeah, heck if I know what they’ll sell there. Probably Windows. So let’s start with a Windows logo. Do a Google Image Search. Damn. That’s ugly. Ok, well, we’ve got to do something. Splat-C Splat-V right into Photoshop. Good. Make it really concrete. Like a square. Ok. Cool. Now make it look like a Window. Ok. So put it next to the Cinnabon logo. Do they clash? No. Ok. How about Spencer’s Gifts? Good. Good. Nice. Ok. So make it look kind of like a Pottery Barn logo but like better. Let’s put some pastel in there. A little more. Got it. 
OK. Now some lighter colors. Yeah. Good. Nice. Ok. Now make it big. Print it out. Ok. We got it. Let’s send in the $1 million dollar design bill and get a Blue Moon.
Don’t forget to eject that USB key and turn off your iMac.
