GPS System Online
Welcome to the world's most simple and inexpensive global position locator. Most Global Position Satellite, or GPS, systems cost hundreds of dollars and take a fair amount of time to learn and use.
Our system does it all in seconds, with little or no learning curve and at a cost that can't be beat: FREE.
How does it work? We have developed a unique, highly advanced global position locator algorithm known as "Internet Global User Exact Specific Site," or "I-GUESS" for short.
By tapping into the digital computer network known as the Internet, we can instantly and precisely calculate your exact location, regardless of where you are on the planet as you access the Internet. That calculation is then sent to you, via the Internet, in graphic form for your use as you see fit.
This remarkable system is freely available to you, giving us an opportunity to further refine the locator algorithm.
To use the I-GUESS system, simply click the "Locate Me" button below. Your results will then appear on another page.
Thank you for trying our unique global position locator.
