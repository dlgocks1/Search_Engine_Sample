Lego is one fun toy to indulge in regardless of your age, and here's one that takes a green approach - the 7" tall Lego minifig that boasts a set of white LED lights located in its right foot. This LED group can be used as a flashlight, and they're powered by a dynamo within that is used to juice up its internal rechargeable batteries through the cranking of the minifig's left arm. Come to think of it, standing at 7" tall, this isn't exactly a minifig no longer. Grab it for around $23 while it is still hot.
