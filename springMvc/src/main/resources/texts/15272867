Marking Intel entrance into the 32nm era, the Clarkdale desktop processors make use of the Socket 1156 platform and are set to debut in Q1. According to a leaked roadmap, Intel's plan is to deliver seven Clarkdale models early next year, all dual-core and all with an integrated graphics core. 
To detail, the Clarkdale release wave will include one Pentium, two Core i3 and five Core i5 models, with frequencies going from 2.8 GHz to 3.46 GHz. The lowest-end chip, the Pentium G6950, works at 2.8 GHz, has 3MB of L3 cache, a DDR3-1066 integrated memory controller, no HyperThreading, a TDP of 73W, and a price tag of $87. 
Boasting 4 threads and 4MB of L3 cache, the rest of the models are clocked at 2.93 GHz (Core i3 530), 3.06 GHz (Core i3 540), 3.20 GHz (Core i5 650), 3.33 GHz (Core i5 660/661), and 3.46 GHz (Core i5 670), and are said to cost $123, $143, $176, $196 and $284, respectively. The three Core i5 CPUs also feature Turbo Boost technology which will enable them to get a clock increase - from 3.2 to 3.46 GHz, from 3.33 to 3.6 GHz, and from 3.46 to 3.73 GHz. 
For those who want more power and/or can't wait for the Clarkdales, Intel is going to less loose the Lynnfield 45nm processors in less than a month.
