HTML 5 Offline Application CacheBeginning in iPhone OS 2.1 and Safari 4.0, Safari provides an offline application cache. This cache allows you to create web-based applications that work correctly even when the user’s computer or web-enabled device is not connected to the Internet.This technology consists of two parts: a manifest file and JavaScript interfaces.The manifest file is a text file that contains a list of resources to be cached.The JavaScript programming interfaces allow you to trigger an update of the cached files when desired.Creating a Manifest FileThe manifest file specifies the resources—such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and image files —to downloaded and store in the application cache. After the first time a webpage is loaded, the resources specified in the manifest file are obtained from the application cache, not the web server.The manifest file has the following attributes:It must be served with type text/cache-manifest.The first line must contain the text CACHE MANIFEST.Subsequent lines may contain URLs for each resource to cache or comments.Comments must be on a single line and preceded by the # character.The URLs are file paths to resources you want to download and cache locally. The file paths should be relative to the location of the manifest file—similar to file paths used in CSS—or absolute.The HTML file that declares the manifest file, described in “Declaring a Manifest File,” is automatically included in the application cache. You do not need to add it to the manifest file.For example, “Creating the index.html File” shows a manifest file that contains URLs to some image resources.Listing 1-1  Sample manifest file
