It is a no brainer by now that any decent cellphone or smartphone these days ought to come with a 3.5mm audio jack instead of those proprietary versions, since most people already own a pair of decent headphones that are connected using the 3.5mm audio connector. Nice to see HTC's Touch Pro2 include this all important connectivity feature, and it has also confirmed that Telus, Verizon and Sprint versions of the Touch Pro2 will all come with an audio jack of this size.
