Tori's eye is a Twitter visualization tool, inspired by papercraft and origami. It's a visual and technical experiment implemented using only standard XHTML/CSS and Javascript.
What does it do?
Enter a word in the search box and then catch some birds with your mouse to read the tweet they're carrying. Tori's Eye fetches the latest tweets containing the word you input from Twitter Search.
So what?
Nothing else, really. Take a moment of your day to watch the birds, grab a few quality tweets... If you wanted an aquarium without the hassle, now you have it.
