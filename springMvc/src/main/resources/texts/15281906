In mathematics, the field with one element is a suggestive name for an object that "should" exist: many objects in math have properties analogous to objects over a field with q elements, where q = 1, and the analogy between number fields and function fields is stronger if one includes a field with one element.[1][2]
An actual field with one element does not exist (the axioms of a field assume 0 ≠ 1, and even if they didn't, the trivial ring (the ring with a single element) does not have the desired properties), but generalizations of fields do exist which have the required properties, for instance as a particular monad:[3]
The ‘field with one element’ is the free algebraic monad generated by one constant (p.26), or the universal generalized ring with zero (p.33)
This object is denoted as or (with a French-English pun)[4] as 
[edit] History
The idea of a field with one element originated in Lie theory, due to q-analogies between structures over Lie groups and combinatorial structures, such as flags and subspaces in vector spaces over finite fields, as discussed below.
It was explicitly identified at least as early as 1957, in the work of Jacques Tits[5] on geometrizing algebraic aspects of Lie theory, in his Tits buildings.
More recently, it has been used in arithmetic algebraic geometry, in relation to the Riemann hypothesis: one approach to the hypothesis has been to try to replicate the proof over function fields, by considering the integers as a curve over a field (formally, a 1-dimensional algebra). The integers are not a curve over any conventional field, but can be considered as a curve over the field with one element, and thus some have studied algebraic geometry over the field with one element. It has recently been connected with noncommutative geometry, by Alain Connes among others, partly in connection with this approach to the Riemann hypothesis.[6][7]
[edit] Philosophy
Under the philosophy of "the field with one element":
Fields are quantum deformations of , where q is the deformation.
Finite sets are projective spaces over 
Pointed sets[8] are vector spaces over 
Finite sets are affine spaces over 
Coxeter groups are simple algebraic groups over 
is[2] a curve over 
Groups are Hopf algebras over ; indeed, for anything categorically defined over both sets and modules, the set-theoretic concept is the -analog
Group actions (G-sets) are projective representations of G over (this agrees with the previous: G is the group Hopf algebra )
[edit] Connections
Given a Dynkin diagram for a simple algebraic group, its Weyl group is[9] the simple algebraic group over 
[edit] Computations
Various structures on a set are analogous to structures on a projective space, and can be computed in the same way:
Points are projective spaces 
The number of elements of , the (n − 1)-dimensional projective space over the n-dimension vector space over the finite field is the q-integer[10]
Taking q = 1 yields [n]q = n.
The expansion of the q-integer into a sum of powers of q corresponds to the Schubert cell decomposition of projective space.
Orders are flags 
There are n! orders of a set, and [n]q! maximal flags in , where is the q-factorial. Indeed, an ordering of a set can be considered a filtered set, as a flag is a filtered vector space: for instance, the ordering (0,1,2) corresponds to the filtration .
Subsets are subspaces 
There are n! / m!(n − m)! m-element subsets of an n element set, and [n]q! / [m]q![n − m]q! m-dimensional subspaces of . The number [n]q! / [m]q![n − m]q! is called a q-binomial coefficient.
The expansion of the q-binomial coefficient into a sum of powers of q corresponds to the Schubert cell decomposition of the Grassmannian.
[edit] Field extensions
One may define field extensions of the field with one element as the group of roots of unity, which is non-naturally isomorphic to the cyclic group of order n, the isomorphism depending on choice of a primitive root of unity:[11]
Thus a vector space of dimension d over is a finite set of order dn on which the roots of unity act freely, together with a base point.
From this point of view the finite field is an algebra over of dimension d = (q − 1) / n for any n that is a factor of q − 1 (for example n = q − 1 or n = 1). This corresponds to the fact that the group of units of a finite field (which are the q − 1 non-zero elements) is a cyclic group of order q − 1, on which any cyclic group of order dividing q − 1 acts freely (by raising to a power), and the zero element of the field is the base point.
Similarly, the real numbers are an algebra over of infinite dimension, as the real numbers contain ±1, but no other roots of unity, and the complex numbers are an algebra over for all n, again of infinite dimension, as the complex numbers have all roots of unity.
From this point of view, any phenomenon that only depends on a field having roots of unity can be seen as coming from – for example, the discrete Fourier transform (complex-valued) and the related number-theoretic transform (-valued).
