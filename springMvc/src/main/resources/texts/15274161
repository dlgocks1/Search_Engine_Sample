A silhouette is defined as an outline that appears dark against a light background. More specifically, it is where your subject is seen as a black shape without detail against a brighter background.
Several things require attention when photographing a silhouette. Here’s how to Photograph Silhouettes. Firstly, the contrast between the subject and the background has to bee extensive. So the light has to shine from behind of the subject.
Silhouettes are a wonderful way to convey drama, mystery, emotion and mood to the viewers of your photos. Objects silhouetted against the setting sun or a halo of light are breathtaking. Art silhouette pictures are a great way to make your photography portfolio stand out.
