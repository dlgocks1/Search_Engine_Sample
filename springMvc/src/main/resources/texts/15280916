BLIGHTY HACKER Gary McKinnon might be interested to know that the US takes a dim view of people trying to use Asperger Syndrome as a defence.
A Los Angeles hacker, Viachelav Berkovich, 34, received a slightly reduced sentence of 55 months in prison for participating in a multi-million dollar computer fraud scheme.
The federal judge took into account the man's diagnosis with Asperger's by lopping a grand total of five months off Berkovich's sentence because of his mental illness.
Berkovich and a mate by the name of Lakes pleaded guilty in February to executing a man-in-the-middle attack that let them run a profitable trucking company without having to drive trucks.
For three years the pair hacked into a California Department of Transportation website called Safersys.org, which maintains a list of licensed interstate trucking companies and freight brokers.
They would temporarily change the contact information for a legitimate trucking company to an address and phone number under their control.
They would then outsource the load to another trucking company posing as the legitimate company whose identity they'd hijacked.
When the company that actually drove the truck tried to get paid, they'd eventually discover that the firm that supposedly had hired them didn't know anything about it.
Kiana Sloan-Hillier, Berkovich's defence lawyer, said that, while the court accepted that her client had the illness, it felt the crime was serious and that a substantial prison sentence was called for to deter others.
Berkovich's crime was less significant than McKinnon's. He's accused of cracking into nearly 100 Pentagon and NASA computers in 2001 and 2002, and allegedly causing $700,000 in damages. Âµ
