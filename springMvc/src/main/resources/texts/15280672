Eston has anounced that they will finally bring the MID ET-M4301 to store shelves soon after debuting the device at the Hong Kong Electronics Fair earlier this April. What makes the ET-M4301 so interesting is its ability to be powered by the Android operating system as well as Windows CE 6.0, depending on your preference. Features include a Marvell PXA303 processor, a 4.3" touchscreen display at 480 x 272 resolution, Wi-Fi connectivity and 128MB RAM. There is no word on pricing as at press time.
