Arco Floor Lamp 
Inspired by the design of a streetlight, the Castiglioni brothers’ dramatic steel and marble Arco Floor Lamp (1962) provides overhead lighting without requiring ceiling suspension. Supported by a weighty marble base, the Lamp’s polished stainless steel shade extends eight feet into a space, leaving room for a dining table or sofa to be positioned underneath the light source. To make the Lamp easier to carry and move, the designers placed a hole in the base that accommodates a broom handle. The edges of the marble block are beveled, which might appear to be decorative, but the real reason the brothers removed the block’s sharp corners was for safety. Designed by Achille Castiglioni and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni for Flos, the Arco Lamp is one of the classics of modern lighting design and is part of MoMA’s permanent collection. Bulb (included): incandescent 100W/120V/E26/A19SB. Made in Italy.

We've launched a contest to coincide with ICFF this year... A design & music mashup. Design Within Reach challenged Parsons Design students to illustrate a "skin" for the GenevaSound Medium all-in-one stereo. Skins are vinyl covers like those used to customize mobiles, laptops, iPods. They are produced by Gelaskins, an artist-driven market for custom covers. 
Vote for your favorite and enter the contest!
