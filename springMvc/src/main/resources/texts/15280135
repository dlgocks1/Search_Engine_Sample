Oh man, a DS Lite for only $89? Tits. Now that the DSi is selling like Devin’s hotcakes, the DS Lite was bound to drop in price. Good thing Target agrees. 
Right now if you use the coupon code TGTBBY92, you can get the Metallic Rose, Cobalt/Black, or Crimson/Black for only $89 bones. That’s cheap, y’all. The normal price is $129. Too bad that the estimated shipping time is 2 to 4 weeks.
