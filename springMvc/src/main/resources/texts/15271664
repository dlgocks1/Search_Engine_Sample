this post’s title sounds like a delicious command, but it’s actually the name of a beautiful “cupcakery” in los olivos, california (the location of friday’s ribbon wedding!). owner/baker amber vander vliet runs enjoy cupcakes within a beautiful wine tasting lounge called saarloos and sons. she thought the interior might be of interest to d*s and well, she was right. i’m a sucker for a place that combines my two favorite things- food and great design. 
my favorite part of amber’s photo tour has got to be the vintage trailer that she brings to special events and farmer’s markets. i wish she would park that portable-cupcake-heaven in front of my front door. i’ve chosen my favorite design details from the shop above and below the jump, but you can check out more images of the tasting room (designed by heather saarloos) and enjoy cupcakes right here. thanks, amber!
