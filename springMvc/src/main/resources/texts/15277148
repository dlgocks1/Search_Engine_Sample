Tiny Help
While out for a walk, I noticed there were many little things on the street that needed some help. I realized that the only way to fix little problems is to get little people! Matty and I happen to be very handy, so I printed pictures of us onto sticker paper, cut us out, and stuck us around the neighborhood.We fixed those little problems like loose nails,broken electrical covers,splitting walls, and giant cracks in steps. Thank goodness Matty is there to hold up that step. It would have surely collapsed by now!Moo just watched us busy at work.  He would have helped, if only he had thumbs.

Candy clouds
The sunsets have been torturing me by looking like candy all week. If I could, I would climb a ladder to the clouds and eat them.I'm 99% sure they're cotton candy.

Feel free to email me at colormekatie@gmail.com if you're looking to hire someone to take some fun portraits. I'd love to meet you!

Interview
The lovely Jess at makeundermylife.com interviewed me about some of the most important rules that I live by. Here's a few that I came up with! Be CreativeIt's important for me to express myself creatively every day. I have all of these fun ideas in my head and if I don't get them out I'm pretty sure my mind would explode. Realistically, I'd probably just get frustrated and fall asleep. But explosion or no explosion, doing something creative acts as a form of therapy for me. I feel better after taking photographs, making street art, painting, or making wall sized collages. The messier and more sweatier I get, the better I feel. Don't grow upWell, not completely anyways. I think it's important to keep that little kid inside of you. I see a lot of people turn into grumpy old men that just complain about everything. I know that we're all adults and we have important adult-like things to do but that doesn't mean we have to let go of that playful side of ourselves. I'm still all about blowing bubbles, running around in the rain, and playing with my food and I always will be! Break your routineI hate the idea of getting up, eating breakfast, and going to work the same way every day. It eventually gets boring and I will not stand for boring! I want to wake up to a day that is always new, so I make sure I change it up a bit. First of all, who made this rule that for breakfast we should eat cereal? If I wake up and want spaghetti, I'll make spaghetti. Whenever I leave the house I go a different way each time. I walk down a new street, ride the bus, take a different train, or hop on a forklift if I can find one! Even if it'll take me longer to get there, I don't care. I just always want to see something new. Be OptimisticIt's raining again? Wonderful! It'll make the flowers grow. I got paint on my favorite coat? Great! I can turn it inside out, sew on new buttons, and make it better than before. There's always a way to find something positive in a situation you would normally think was negative. Give yourself a gift everydayThere are some days that can feel so long but it makes it a lot easier to get through if you give yourself a gift. I always like to give myself something little like a cupcake, a flower, balloons, or an iced coffee at my favorite cafe. It's not expensive and it's a lovely little pick me up during the day. Be yourselfI'm not perfect, I know that. I have this thing where I trip at least once a day and somehow my dress will always find a way to fall down at the most inappropriate moments. I say the wrong things at wrong times and only get the giggles when I'm alone on the train, which makes me look like a crazy person. I used to be really embarrassed of myself when I was younger but now I find all these little things to be funny and they make me who I am. The next time my dress accidently falls down at a funeral, it'll fall with pride! So now I'm curious, what are some of the ways you live your life? I'd love to know!

First
The most wonderful thing happened this morning.I found the first photos I'd ever taken!It brought back all these warm memories of discovering my dad's old camera and realizing that this felt right for me =) For all of you other picture takers out there, when did you first pick up a camera and fall in love? ( I was 17!)

Dancing
I find dancing to be so hilarious. We hear a beat and suddenly our limbs have an urge to be all wiggly. Have you ever seen a person dance that was angry?no way!That's why if everyone in the world would just dance at the same time we'd have world peace. Problem solved! ;)

Cat Alarm Clock
Every morning Moo knocks on the door to wake us up. I had no idea that he doubled as an alarm clock. This morning I set him for 6:55. He was right on time.

Silhouette Portraits
Silhouette portraits are nice but wouldn't they be more fun if they weren't always in that same profile position? After playing with a few ideas, I ended up creating a fun series of silhouettes where they're all interacting with each other and even escaping their frames! I have a DIY section in Time Out New York magazine on how to make them. I'm also doing a give away of one of my prints so enter here for a chance to win!

Inexpensive Wallpaper
I found these old comic books at a thrift shop for only 50 cents each! I absolutely adore the illustrations so I cut out the most colorful pages and covered one of my walls. It makes pretty fun wallpaper!

Under-Roos
Most of my day was spent upside-down. Radar (the weekly series that made the mini-doc on my street art) is having a big screening party where they will be showing all 12 episodes of the artists they documented! They asked me to create new pieces to put up at the show so I've been busy at work... ...meaning I've been hanging out in my under-roos all day taking photos. I think these silly legs could be fun in someone's thought bubble!They made a short mash up of all of our episodes. How fun is this video? All these people are so inspirational!

Chihuahua
For about 2 hours yesterday I had a dog that I named ChiChi! I found this little guy roaming the streets looking very scared so I brought him home. Moo was so jealous!I took a few pictures of him so that I could make flyers to put up around the neighborhood (it's funny how glorious he looks in this shot). Luckily, I found his owner at a store asking the manager if he had seen her dog. She was so happy to see him she was crying. It felt so good to help! Taking this picture reminded me about my 100 pet project. I haven't had time to work on it but I'm really going to try!
