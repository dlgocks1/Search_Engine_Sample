Personally, typography and cool type treatments are my absolute favorite when it comes to design. There is an endless amount of room for creativity but still somewhat of a structure to follow leading to some real problems to solve and producing some real epic pieces of art. We all know typography has been around forever. But lately there has really been an outburst of some really amazing forward thinkers in the field. It seems that people are really finally grasping onto type as an aesthetic and not so much as… well… just text! Here are some of my favorite pieces to share with you! Enjoy!
