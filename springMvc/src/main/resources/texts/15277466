A symbol of success & Grammy nominated R&B Singer poses in a ‘Shaved Head’ and joins the ever increasing female shaved-head-group.
Known as a singing icon, Keyshia seems to have followed the footprints of Cassie, Solange (Beyonce’s sister), Rihanna and a former MTV fame LaLa who all had adopted this ‘change’ in their lives at least once.
Celebrities know how to attract the people and how to derive their attention and that’s what Keyshia did. She was born in Oakland, California in 1981. She is a song-writer too and her songs ‘Let it go,’ ‘I remember’ and ‘Heaven Sent’ achieved the #1 status for her.
It is also on record that her program rather a reality show known as “The Way It is” is considered the most-watched program in the history of BET. “Playa Cardz Right” was her first single and that too had a top 15 chart position in its first three weeks. Then she has worth remembering songs like “I Should Have Cheated;” “Love,” “Let it Go,” “I Remember,” “Heaven Sent,” “Last Night” (w/P. Diddy) and “Give it Up to Me.”
Keyshia has also been nominated for two Grammy awards in 2007. “Best Contemporary R&B Album” for “Just like You” whereas “Best Rap-Sung Collaboration” for “Let it Go.”
The word is in the air that she is due for a tour with ‘Rihanna’ who wishes some ‘strong women’ to accompany her on a ‘women empowerment’ kind of tour in September. This shows she rates Keyshia as ‘Strong,’ quite a complement!
