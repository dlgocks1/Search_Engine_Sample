Compatibility for hardware, applications, and middleware
The IBM ServerProven® program validates
selected products for compatibility with IBM System x®, BladeCenter® and xSeries® servers. Through the ServerProven Program, IBM works with industry
leaders to test their equipment with ours. We recognize that you
deserve the most innovative solutions...even if they're not all from
IBM. 
IBM ServerProven provides compatibility information only. Hardware configuration guidance can be obtained from the Configuration and Options Guide. Product ordering information can be obtained from the Sales Configurators. These configurators can be accessed through the link "Configuration Tools" which is located on the left side of this page. 
IBM makes no representations or warranty regarding third-party products or services, including those designated as ServerProven or ClusterProven®. Support for these third-party (non-IBM) products is provided by non-IBM Manufacturers.
