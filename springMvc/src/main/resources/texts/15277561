Abbey Roadâs famous pedestrian crossing, live webcam.The Crossing
Welcome to Abbey Road, one of the most famous, authoritative and popular names in the world of music.
We have been at the heart of the music industry for over 75 years and have welcomed thousands of the worlds most celebrated artists, record labels, producers, managers, composers, orchestras, film companies, directors and actors, to the studios. 
One of our most famous clients, The Beatles, recorded 90% of their recordings at Abbey Road studios. In April 1969, they came together to record their final album as a group and titled it ‘Abbey Road.’ This album became their best selling work and featured Abbey Road Studios and the now iconic image of the zebra crossing on the front cover.
Here, you can see for yourself the most famous black and white stripes in London by viewing our webcam, which is trained on the crossing 24 hours a day.
