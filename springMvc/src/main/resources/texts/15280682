In the words of Emperor Palpatine as he blasted Mace Windu with a torrent of Force Lightning, "More power!!!" That's what some Asus Eee PC owners wish they had when it comes to the brightness level on their netbooks, and it is good to know that the eeectl software utility is available for download. This software is used to adjust your precious netbook’s backlight setting all the way to the "hidden" ultra bright level, where it will almost double the ed/m2 value of your netbook’s display. Needless to say, running at such high levels of brightness has its pros and cons, where the trade-off would include a drastic reduction in battery life in addition to changing the display of black values due to the increased brightness.
