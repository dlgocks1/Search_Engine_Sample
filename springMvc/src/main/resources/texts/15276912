National Carbon Explorer
The process of sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) involves identifying sources that produce CO2 and sinks where the CO2 can be stored. These web pages present interactive maps and background information on the process of storing CO2. This Atlas is created by the NatCarb project and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory.
Use the links at left to explore climate change, common sources of greenhouse gasses, and the many ways those gases can be removed from the atmosphere and stored. The 2008 atlas is available as...
