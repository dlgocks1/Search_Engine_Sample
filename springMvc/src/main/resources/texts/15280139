This screen option isn’t too much of a surprise seeing as the 17-inch MBP gained it a bit ago, but starting a few hours ago, buyers can once again select a matte screen in the 15-inch MacBook Pro for a price. 
The $50 option isn’t for everyone. Some peeps actually like the glossy screens that turn into mirrors when sunlight hits them. But I guess if you don’t venture out into the real world and mooch off of coffee shops, then the glossy screen might be a better option. At least we can all agree that this $50 solution right from the manufacturer is a lot better than paying $200 for a 3rd-party company to do it for you.
