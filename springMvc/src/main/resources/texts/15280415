Animalia - Chordata - Agnatha 
Ichthyomyzon unicuspis 
The picture is of the northern hemisphere parasitic species Ichthyomyzon unicuspis. The individual on the left is a male who was very near to spawning. The individual on the right is a female that was spawning when caught. Their total body lengths are approximately 18cm for the female and slightly larger for the male as he isn't spawning yet, around 22 cm. The length bar isn't on this picture but the oral disc of the female is approximately 1cm cross just to give you an idea of the size of their head region.
