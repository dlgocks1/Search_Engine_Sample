Sometimes I feel I've got to Run away 
I've got to Get away 
From the pain that you drive in the heart of me 
The love we share 
Seems to go nowhere 
I've lost my lights 
I toss and turn I can't sleep at night 
Once I ran to you (I ran) 
Now I'll run from you 
This tainted love you've given 
I give you all a boy could give you 
Take my tears and that's not nearly all 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Now I know I've got to Run away 
I've got to Get away 
You don't really want any more from me 
To make things right 
You need someone to hold you tight 
You think love is to pray 
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way 
Once I ran to you (I ran) 
Now I'll run from you 
This tainted love you've given 
I give you all a boy could give you 
Take my tears and that's not nearly all 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Don't touch me please 
I cannot stand the way you tease 
I love you though you hurt me so 
Now I'm going to pack my things and go 
Touch me baby, tainted love 
Touch me baby, tainted love 
Touch me baby, tainted love 
*Touch me baby, tainted love* 
Once I ran to you (I ran) 
Now I'll run from you 
This tainted love you've given 
I give you all a boy could give you 
Take my tears and that's not nearly all 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
*Tainted love*

Review about Tainted Love 
MM fan | Reviewer: amanda | 3/27/2008 
i love all of Marilyn Manson's songs.. like this is the new shit.. i know it off By heart.. n me n my friends will start singing it in the halls at our school.. n get weird looks from the preps.. but what ever being different is way better then being the same.. it makes everything so boring.. well Marilyn keep up the great work<3

This is the best song ever. Seriously Marilyn Manson's work is worth listening to. Some people say he's too offensive and obscene, and he has no musical talent. Well, to all those people who say that, you are wrong. If u just listen to the music, you'll find the creative masterpieces to be fenomenal and amazing, I love it. The original is okay, but Manson takes it to a different level <3

okay so here's the dealio... 
There are so many remakes of Tainted Love it's not even funny. But the one by Marily Manson I would have to say is quite catchy. Marilyn's voice sounds incredible, and makes the song sound almost indescrible unless you listen to the lyrics. 
I like the original. but this one is also very good :)

Tainted Love i's a great song. | Reviewer: Anonymous | 9/1/2007 
I love Tainted love it's a great song. i mean Marilyn Manson gave it a bit more. but i also like the original. 
Why give MM the credit - call it by name - a cover of a better bands song | Reviewer: Big-T | 8/11/2007 
For a song by Soft Cell - originally released on the "non-stop cabaret" album? I agree MM is ugly - hideous - and in fact - I find him/her quite offensive - but I guess that's what he wants - for us to find offense in everything 
Still - I like the original better :)
