After the first round of community consultation, the Bazaar home page wireframe has been updated and the basic shape has gone to the designers for graphical treatment. (You can read the mailing list summary.) Not including the footer, the home page has gone from 700+ words to less than 300 words. The wireframe still feels full, but there's order to it now.
The text is now on a community-editable Wiki page. If you have a Launchpad account, you can help out! Head on over to the Bazaar Web site Home Page Text wiki page and help write a new heading to replace, "VCS Soution." It's the best manager-speak heading that means nothing and yet sounds fancy. When you're editing the page, be sure to keep the personas for the front page in mind. I'll be adding links to existing content on the wiki page too.
While we wait for the graphical treatment for the front page, we'll start working on the inside landing pages. These will include wireframes for the topic home pages including: Hosting, Plugins, Workflows, Developers, Support and Documentation.
