Following hot on the heels of a similar outing from Samsung, it seems that RIM's finally wading into the oversized novelty smart phone market. Josh T: "Even at that size, the Storm was still difficult to type on." Tim: "HELLO? WHAT? NO I'M IN A SWIMMING POOL. YEAH, IT'S RUBBISH." Darren: "Clickable touchscreen, huh? Riiiiiight." Jacob: "I never thought the Storm could've been such a lifesaver." Laura: "I'm not sure this is what people meant when they said RIM should try to make a BlackBerry that appeals to younger people." Joe: "Looks like it's time to try out that 'rice bowl' trick." Ross: "It's pretty rude of him to sit on those text messages all day." Don: "Gotta watch out for those deep end roaming charges." Nilay: "A U2 backstage pass is not what it used to be." Chris: "Analysts say that the Storm's price is inflated and RIM's touchscreen support is still in its infancy."
