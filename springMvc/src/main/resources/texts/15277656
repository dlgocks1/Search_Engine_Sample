It was a few months ago, however the videos from the Ubuntu Developer Summit have finally been made available to me in a streamable form.  This was a short, unrehearsed talk I gave to briefly convince the Ubuntu developer community that Wine isn’t a threat to free software, but rather an important tool that makes migration to a free platform possible.
Advice for those giving presentations
After rewatching the above, I can say the following things with confidence.
The fewer words on your slides, the better.
Bullet points aren’t short enough.
If you start with a borrowed joke it will come off awkward.
Unless you can’t be funny, write your own jokes.
Never let someone control the slides for you.
Wine Bug Day this Sunday
Now, while I have your attention, how about you participate in the next Wine Bug Day for this Sunday?  It’s very simple - mostly we’re just downloading random games and playing them for a bit to see if a bug is still there.  And it all helps Wine development, so it’s good.  Check out the wiki page and join us!
