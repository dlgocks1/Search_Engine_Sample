Snow Leopard vs. Windows 7: The War of the Wallpapers
“I would give a lot to have Steve’s taste.”
Bill Gates said that of Steve Jobs at the D5 conference two years ago, and we knew exactly what he meant.
Take, for example, the two images above. They are samples of the new desktop images offered by this fall’s big operating system updates: Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows 7, scheduled for release in October, and Apple’s (AAPL) Snow Leopard, due in September.
Can you guess which is which?
Gates may have retired as CEO and Jobs may have spent much of 2009 on medical leave, but the taste gap persists.

Steve Jobs, goes the old joke at Apple, is surrounded by a reality distortion field; get too close and you believe what he's saying. Apple has made believers out of millions of customers -- and made a lot of investors rich -- but Philip Elmer-DeWitt believes that an ounce of skepticism never hurts when writing about the company. He should know. He's been covering Apple - and watching Steve Jobs operate -- since 1982.
