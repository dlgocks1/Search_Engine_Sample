One can only guess at what the occasion for this LIFE Magazine photo shoot was, but it must have been long remembered in the halls of NCS. Apparently a bunch of strip cartoonists were brought out to draw on the bathing suits of a bunch of comely young models. All that’s missing is a bunch of those cartoon sweat drops (”plewds”) surrounding the heads of these guys as they try to get a ballpoint pen to draw over the nylon-encased curves of the models’ “hites.”
Behold, Ernie Bushmiller. 
Oh, Alfred Andriola! You didn’t!!
We’re not sure who this scamp is.
Nor the identities of these frumpy biddies. 
Many thanks to Lance Smith for the link, who says “The whole set is filed under Ball Point Bathing Suits and is dated January 1, 1950 and is credited to Bernard Hoffman. Some of the other artists are Alfred Andriola (Kerry Drake), Bill Holman (Smokey Stover), Otto Soglow (The Little King) and maybe Harold Gray.”
