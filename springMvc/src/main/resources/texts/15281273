Britons do not scrub up well with two in five men and a third of women failing 
to have a daily shower, research revealed today.
Just over one in ten (11.5%) people in the UK only have a proper wash once or 
twice a week, a poll for tissue product manufacturer SCA found.
This puts us behind France, Mexico and Australia in the cleanliness stakes.
Researchers found that 41.1% of British men and 33.1% of women do not have a 
shower every day.
However, it does not seem to put off the opposite sex - 32.7% of women and 
22.2% of men said they would date someone who did not wash every day.
And 40.4% of those polled said they would employ a shower-shy worker.
The smelliest people in the UK come from Yorkshire where 16% of people shower 
once or twice a week, and only half (54%) do so daily.
London is the cleanest, where three-quarters (75.9%) of the inhabitants shower 
or bath at least once per day and 16.3% do twice.
*The results incorporate research from a poll of 4,842 people in Mexico, 
Australia, the US, France, the UK, Russia, Sweden, Germany and China in 
2008, and two further surveys of a total of 1,153 people in the UK.
