We kept an eye on Tomotaka Takahashi, the inventor of Evolta, as he was trying get his robot rolling for 24 hours non-stop on the Le Mans race track. Now, it's official, the robot did pedaled non-stop for 24 hours and covered 23.726km in the process (it was following the infra-red beam from a lead car). The robot was powered only by a pair of AA Evolta batteries from Panasonic, the sponsor behind the attempt. Other records include climbing the Grand Canyon.
