I specialise in images of landscapes, seascapes and natural forms and am interested in how the changing light and weather conditions can transform the landscape into a spectacle of form, tone, light and colours.
I hope to capture the essence of what I see and feel in order to create an emotional response of wonder, delight and surprise that celebrates the beauty of nature.
Memories of times spent in special places with friends and family are important to me as well as the asthetic and emotional qualities that the image portrays.
Having invested in the latest digital equipment I am able to create my own digital workflow that allows me complete control over the quality of my fine-art work.
I hope you enjoy looking at my images on the Gallery Pages and they are also available to purchase as limited edition giclee prints on archival fine-art papers.
