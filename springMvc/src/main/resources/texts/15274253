Naxos Records is a record label for classical music compact discs and DVDs. 
Founded in 1987 by Klaus Heymann, a German-born resident of Hong Kong, the label today is one of the biggest classical music labels, and has recently begun distributing DVDs as well. Despite a general decline in classical music sales, Naxos is one of the two largest-selling classical labels in the world.[1] In 2005 Naxos won the ”Label of the Year Award” at Classic FM/Gramophone awards. In 2003 Naxos started a paid subscription service (it had previously been free) offering their complete catalogue (as well as joint labels) for listening on the Internet as the Naxos Music Library. 
In 2007 Naxos opened its online DRM-free music download store as ClassicsOnline.com[2] with 128kbps MP3 format, on the first anniversary in 2008, it began transcoding its audio tracks into 320kbps MP3[3]. It is now offering about to offer selected tracks and albums in FLAC lossless format.
