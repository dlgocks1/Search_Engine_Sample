ICML 2007: some statistics
• 522 submissions
• 150 accepted
• 29% acceptance rate
…can we predict acceptance?
ML on ICML
• Extracted stems of words from titles and
abstracts of all submitted papers.
• Computed P(word | accepted) by counting the
proportion of accepted papers that included that
particular word.
P(word | not accepted) computed analogously.
• Ranked each word by the odds of acceptance:
P(accepted | word) / P(not accepted | word)
• Prepositions and adverbs were removed.
• The top 20 stems according to this are…

ICML Topic evolution

• Thanks to Mark Reid for these statistics
of ICML titles
• stemmed, picked ~20 most common
words in titles for last 20 years
• smoothed and plotted
Topic Evolution
Do High Bids Predict Accept?
• 8 papers with >30 high bids
• How many of these were accepted?
• 0!
• p=0.064 under null hyp of accept=0.29
• Papers submitted early tend to have more bids.
• Lesson: don’t make your paper popular for
bidding :-)
Reviewing Process Innovations
• Reviewer assignment process:
– (1) automatic assignment (PCs and SPCs) based on
bids.
– (2) SPCs suggest changes to PC assignments,
– (3) manual implementation of these suggestions +
rebalancing
• Two discussion periods led by the senior program
committee (SPC), one just before and one after the
submission of author responses. At the end of the
second discussion period, the SPC members gave their
recommendations and provided a summary review for
each of their papers. (296 posts in discussion 1, 1011
posts in discussion 2). SPC discussion involvement
very variable.
Reviewing Process Innovations
• Authors were asked to submit a list of
changes with their ﬁnal accepted papers,
which was checked by the SPCs to ensure
that reviewer comments had been addressed.
• Very few conditional accepts (25).
Dual Submission Policy
• The ICML policy is that it should be clear which
parts of a submitted paper are original
contributions and which parts are review of
previously published or simultaneously
submitted work. If two papers contain a signiﬁcant
amount of material that reviewers could think is
original, but that in fact also appears in a separate
previous or simultaneously submitted paper, then it
becomes impossible to assess the signiﬁcance of the
novel material in a paper. These cases will be
considered dual-submissions and automatically
rejected.
Recommendations for
future Program Chairs
• Coordinate with Program Chairs of
simultaneous conferences to find dual
submissions.
• Allow more time for paper assignment and
initial review.
• Re-organize and rationalize list of topics,
having more topics and keywords is useful.
• Randomize order of papers presented during
bidding.
A Possible Future Innovation
in the Review Process?
• For each accepted paper, each
reviewer is allowed to submit a short
commentary summarizing the paper
and putting it into perspective.
• These non-anonymous comments are
published with the paper, along with an
author reply.
Other Innovations
• Abstract booklet
• USB drives with proceedings
• Moving towards no printed proceedings?
Program Chair perspective
• 10,000+ emails!

THANKS to SPCs, PCs, and Additional Reviewers!

Suggestions from audience..
• web site should have proceedings page
numbers. Proceedings on arXiv?
• authors should be able to rate
reviewers.
• randomize (or reverse) order of papers
presented during bidding.
• Workshops need to be solicited, we
need more workshops.
