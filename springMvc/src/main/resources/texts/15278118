Some of you may be too young to remember this, but back in the mid-90's, Bullfrog were kings. Theme Park, Magic Carpet, Syndicate...everything Peter Molyneux's former studio released turned to gold.
But then Bullfrog were sold to EA. And Molyneux went off and formed Lionhead. And...all people were left with was an innate desire to complain to publishers about how there should be remake upon remake of Bullfrog's classic titles.
Complaints that EA - who hold the rights to Bullfrog's back catalogue - have heard. EA's Harvey Elliot has told Kikizo that many of those old games are worth a second look:
If you remember all the old classics you played, if you go back and play them now, they're not the same. They were right for their time, and the trick with those games is coming up with what's right for the time now. I'm going to look at them at some point, I think there's an opportunity to bring those back in the future, but only if it's right for the time and not just a 'remake' or something. We'd need to do it in a way that's true to the original values, but would still make a great game today.
Know what would make Syndicate great today? Take the original Syndicate, put it in a new box and sell it.
