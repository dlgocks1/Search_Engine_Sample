Abstract  This study examined: (a) the prevalence of bullying and victimization among adolescents with ASD, (b) whether they correctly
perceived bullying and victimization, and (c) whether Theory of Mind (ToM) and bullying involvement were related to this perception.
Data were collected among 230 adolescents with ASD attending special education schools. We found prevalence rates of bullying
and victimization between 6 and 46%, with teachers reporting significantly higher rates than peers. Furthermore, adolescents
who scored high on teacher- and self-reported victimization were more likely to misinterpret non-bullying situations as bullying.
The more often adolescents bullied, according to teachers and peers, and the less developed their ToM, the more they misinterpreted
bullying situations as non-bullying. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.
