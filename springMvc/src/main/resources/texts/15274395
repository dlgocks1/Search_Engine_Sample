Japan's central bank has kept its key interest rate unchanged and underlined its cautious outlook for the economy.The board of the Bank of Japan unanimously opted to kept interest rates at 0.1% after a two-day meeting. It said conditions in the world's second largest economy had stopped worsening but that unemployment would stay high and consumer spending low. Analysts do not expect Japan's central bank to raise rates for some time, predicting a slow recovery. "We are expecting the rebound to slow down somewhat later this year or early next year," said Hiroshi Shiraishi, an economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. Interest rates have been on hold since December, when Japan reduced rates from 0.3%. Also on Tuesday, the Cabinet Office issued a cautious monthly report. While it said the economy was "picking up" it added it remained in a "difficult situation." Japan, which is heavily reliant on exports, has been hit by the slowdown in demand overseas.
