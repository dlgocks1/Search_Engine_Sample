Update (9:00 PM): Added last scan, Charizard G, thanks to DNA.
For some reason I can’t get the program that creates the scan lists to work, so I’m just going to post all the scans as thumbnails for now in this news story. Thanks go to Torterra Chips, Mega Tank, Matt, kirbypopstarhero, Jaimonster, Fortegoddx, and DNA for scanning the cards we were missing from our first post on Friday!
