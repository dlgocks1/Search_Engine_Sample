This unique watch follows other TokyoFlash offerings where it will take some time before you actually figure out how to tell the exact time, as it features a column of ten LED lights that will indicate the current time in place of the standard hands and numbers. You will need to push a button located on the side to turn the LED lights on though, where they will race to the current digit before trailing off, leaving but a solitary light to reconfirm the number. This action will be repeated thrice for each digit of the current time. Guess it is gonna take a while before you actually get used to telling the time with this, since you can't do so with but a glance. Still, at least it is a different idea from the usual analog and digital watch faces. The TokyoFlash Retsu is going for $146 a pop.
