WITH the dark satanic rumour mill churning out yarns that Apple is about to release a tablet, no one seems to have paused to ask "who the hell wants one?"
True there are Apple fanboys who will buy what ever Steve tells to them to as part of their Think Different philosophy, but what about the real world?
While such gadgets get good coverage from tech sites, the reality is that they have not done very well in the real world at all.
This is partly because they can't actually do that much, and they always cost a lot to make and thus to buy.
Touch screens are pretty cool on smartphones, but when they get bigger the law of diminishing returns kicks in. To write anything useful you need a proper keyboard, which is something a tablet famously lacks.
Typing on a screen is nearly impossible and remember you have to see what you are typing at the same time.
True it would be better for browsing the web on the move which, face it, is useless on a smartphone. But that is a function neatly done by netbooks.
According to rumour, Apple's tablet will be priced at $700 to $800. I will not predict it will die, because Apple has been good at making people pay lots of cash for stuff people don't really need for years. But Crunchpad will be its main rival and that will be $400.
Even that is probably too high when you can get a less attractive netbook for about $200 which will do the same things.
Apple should know better. Its previous attempt (remember Newton?) did very badly. So have Microsoft's moves in this area.
My only guess is that Apple has got so arrogant on the back of its Iphone success that it thinks it can sell a gizmo it could never shift before. Âµ
