Dananananaykroyd had to abandon their Sydney show on July 29, after drummer John Baillie Junior fell offstage and broke his arm.
The band were two songs in to their set at the Annandale Hotel when Baillie Junior suffered the accident, reports ABC.net. Luckily for the band, a doctor was on hand in the audience to attend to him.
“The details still aren’t really very clear. John, I think he just kind of came off the stage a bit funny and has done something pretty bad to his arm. The latest I’ve heard is that he’s taken a bit of his elbow bone off,” singer Callum Gunn explained. Read further here.
So unfortunately Dananananaykroyd canceled a couple of shows. Let’s just hope they won’t be missing Incubate, as we’re really looking forward to seeing these guys perform here! On their myspace thay cancelled everything before August 28th, so we should be fine here in Tilburg, as they are scheduled to play September 18th over here. We wish John luck and hope to welcome him in September!
