Microsoft Office Web Apps lack official support for Chrome, Opera
Responding to the Google Docs threat, Microsoft is planning to introduce Office Web Applications next year, with a technical preview set to go live soon for testing and early accommodation. Unfortunately, as revealed by Gareth Howell, Program Manager for Office Web Apps, the online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote may not work for a good bunch of people as some browser won't be supported. 
Howell states that the Office Web Apps officially support Internet Explorer 7 and 8, Firefox 3.5 for Windows, Mac and Linux and Safari 4 for Mac, leaving those who prefer Safari 4 for Windows, Opera, and Chrome, to try their luck, and if things don't work properly, to switch browsers. Microsoft's decision to not ensure the apps work on the three browsers is rather disappointing because although none holds a significant piece of the market, they are all pretty much up to date feature wise to the 'approved' browsers. 
The silver lining for users of the mentioned browsers is that Microsoft will look into expanding the Office Web Apps' support later on. Hopefully by the time they launch next year, this problem will be solved.
