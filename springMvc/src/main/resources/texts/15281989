THIS baby elephant suffered a trunkful of trouble when it fell through the 
manhole of a drainage ditch. 
The beast kicked up a right stink after it slipped through the narrow opening 
in eastern Thailand. 
The accident happened as the elephant's owner took it out on the street to 
work. 
A team of rescuers took THREE HOURS to release the animal which escaped 
from the ordeal unharmed. 
Bulldozers were used to widen the drain's hole, before the baby jumbo was 
lifted out. 
Luckily the rescuers were up to the draining tusk.
