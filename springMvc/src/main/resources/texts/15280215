It feels like we know everything about the Zune HDâ€”except the price. Well, now we know, if Best Buy's inventory system is right: the 16GB model will go for $220, and the 32GB model will be $290.
It also backs up the previously rumored launch date, Sept. 8.
Those prices look dirt cheap compared to the current iPod touch pricing, making the Zune HD seem super competitive now, but you gotta figure the touch's prices are gonna get re-aligned shortly after the Zune HD's launch, so it might look a little different then. Still, things look good so far for the Zune HD. [Thanks tipster!]
