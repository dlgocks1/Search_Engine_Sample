Don't look at the rather hideous sample video; this 30-minute videotutorial on Blender fluids by Greg Dunn is actually a rather good introduction.
Greg writes:
Learning to simulate realistic fluids in any 3d app is always a challenge, but Blender's sophisticated solver allows for some very rewarding results.
In this introduction to Blender fluid simulations, you will learn the basics of how to set up a fluid simulation in Blender with an obstacle, and a few fluid set ups to give you an idea of some of the other things that you can do with Blender fluids.
