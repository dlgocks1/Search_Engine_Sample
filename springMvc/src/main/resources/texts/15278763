>> It's the moment we've been waiting for: a peek at Jil Sander's return to fashion.  Vogue has the first look of her +J line for Uniqlo, full of "masculine shirts with tiny, crisp collars; cuffed flannel pants; blazers with collar straps so they can be worn snugly buttoned up; and coats - many, many coats; . . . teeny-tiny cotton skirts; . . . legging-pants," in cotton, wool, or nylon.  
The palette sticks to gray, black, and khaki, "with the occasional splash of purple or pink," and although we're hearing the line is 140 pieces and hitting stores in October with prices starting at around $25, Vogue says the prices haven't been finalized - although nothing will be over $149.50 - and as for a store date, "Fall is all Uniqlo wants to say."
