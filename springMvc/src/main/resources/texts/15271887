As Levitt once noted, getting a paper published in an academic journal is an often comically belabored process, and of course it’s even worse when the paper is rejected. Here’s some new hope for the rejects: Rejecta Mathematica is an online journal that only publishes mathematics papers that were turned down by peer-reviewed journals. Its aim, as the Economist reports, is to “highlight papers that, although perhaps flawed, may still be interesting.” Still, it’s not a publishing free-for-all: even Rejecta rejects a few.
