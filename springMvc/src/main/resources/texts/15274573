Info 
H2O: Footprints in the Sand is a Japanese adult visual novel by Makura which was released on June 23, 2006 for the PC. H2O is Makura's first game. The gameplay in H2O follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters. There are two modes of gameplay, the Blindness Effect and Normal Effect, where the former plays on the fact that the protagonist is blind, and the latter mode removes the added element of gameplay the Blindness Effect has. The story is broken into three parts: the original introduction and meeting, following by a separation and reunion, and finally ending with the protagonist choosing one of the girls and spending the rest of the game with her.
