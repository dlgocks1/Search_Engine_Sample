Jil Sander built her reputation—and her brand, now helmed by Raf Simons—on minimal design, exacting standards, and excellence of construction. She was reputed to be something of a taskmaster around the studio. The best news we've heard about +J, her new line from Uniqlo? She still is. 
Fast fashion notwithstanding, Sander oversaw all aspects of her men's and women's collections for the Japanese retailer, from developing the fabrics (including woven wools, cotton poplins, and high-shine twills) to overseeing production at the brand's Chinese facilities. The result is a line that's simple, well cut, clever in its (minimal) detailing, and highly wearable. We can't say we're surprised—Uniqlo has done a nice job with its collaborators in the past, including detail-oriented types like Tim Hamilton and Stefan Miljanic of Gilded Age. The 40-piece men's +J collection, consisting of suiting separates, outerwear, trousers, button-downs, and knits, improves on those limited editions in one way, though: It will continue for seasons to come. And while dates of arrival ("this fall" is all we could get from the company) and exact prices are TBD, this much is certain: No piece will be over $200.
