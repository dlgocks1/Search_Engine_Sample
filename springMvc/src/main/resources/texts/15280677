Check out this rather cool video of the Sticky Light project concocted by students at the Department of Information Physics and Computing at the Ishikawa Komuro Laboratory of the University of Tokyo.
Sticky Light is a 3D tracking technology using a laser diode (low power), a pair of steering mirrors and a single non-imaging photodetector. The big difference to other tracking technologies is the fact that the Sticky Light doesnâ€™t use a camera or projector. So what could you do with it? It can track the contour of objects and even augment real-time drawings. Or you could build games like air hockey or a pinball game.
Sounds pretty interesting, do you think something like this will make it to the world of console gaming in the near future?
