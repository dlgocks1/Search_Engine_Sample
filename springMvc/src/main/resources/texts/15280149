Sure, it's more or less just a BlackBerry Onyx with a trackpad, but slap a T-Mobile logo on it, and the excitement is all rejuvenated. Such a device was spotted in the wild by the folks at Crackberry, sporting a silver chrome and a leather-clad battery cover. Not much to say here, but with that branding, we're hoping it's not long before heading into the consumer channels. Don't worry AT&T friends, we're sure your GSM-equipped 9700 is just around the corner, too.
