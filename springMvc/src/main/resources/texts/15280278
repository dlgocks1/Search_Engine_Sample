Lescott, 27, submitted his request to leave earlier today (Tues), but Moyes 
has dismissed out of hand the prospect of selling the former Wolves defender.
City are understood to be ready to make a final offer of £22m for the player 
following Lescott's decision to go public on his desire to leave Goodison 
Park for Eastlands.
But Moyes insists that Lescott, currently in Holland ahead of England's 
friendly in Amsterdam on Wednesday, will not be leaving the Merseyside club.
Moyes said: "Joleon Lescott put in a written transfer request this 
morning which I immediately rejected.
"We will continue to work with him as we appreciate his many qualities as 
a player. I have said all along that I have no intention of selling my best 
players. Joleon is simply not for sale."
City have made offers of £15m and £19m for Lescott already this summer after 
manager Mark Hughes identified the versatile defender as the ideal man to 
play at centre-half and also act as cover for Wayne Bridge at full-back.
Having believed that the prospects of signing Lescott were dead on Monday 
morning, City were given encouragement by sources unrelated to Everton 
during the day that a deal might yet be possible.
But Everton have maintained throughout the transfer saga that they will not 
sell and Moyes's rapid rejection of Lescott's transfer request underlines 
his determination to win out.
With Phil Jagielka set to be sidelined until December with a cruciate knee 
ligament injury, Moyes is reluctant to weaken his defensive options by 
selling Lescott.
And City are now preparing to shift their sights elsewhere, with West Ham 
defender Matthew Upson and Portsmouth's Sylvain Distin now set to be subject 
of bids before the season opener against Blackburn at Ewood Park on Saturday.
