Unscientific America How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future by Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum Basic Books, New York, 2009. 223 pp. $24, £13.99, C$30.50. ISBN 9780465013050.
In addition to discussing threats posed by scientific illiteracy, Mooney and Kirshenbaum argue that American ignorance of science stems from the vociferous atheism of some prominent science popularizers and scientists' insufficient interest in and preparation for outreach activities.
