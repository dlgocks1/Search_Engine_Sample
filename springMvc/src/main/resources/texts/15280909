APPLE IS IN a bit of a panic after its own habitually fawning press have started to turn on the company over its customer shafting ways.
Comments on Apple support forums indicate that the latest Macbook Pros suffer from a glitch that begins when the 7,200 RPM Seagate hard disk drive (HDD) starts making clicking and beeping noises, which are often a precursor to disk slowdowns and freeze-ups.
Apple had been ignoring the problem in its traditional way of dealing with people objecting to flaws in its machines.
However it fast became clear that the problem was not going to go away. It appears that the fault is with the anti-drop sensor in the Seagate Momentus 7200.4 HDD (model ST9500420ASG). The problem apparently happens whether the computer is being moved or is stationary.
Apple has not admitted that there is a problem with the Momentus hard drive. It just said that it is working on a fix for the problem.
It probably would not even have done that if Appleinsider hadn't started sticking the knife in by printing angry user comments.
Appleinsider has also come up with a fix. Users appeared to be able to resolve the problem by replacing the beeping and clicking Momentus 7200.4 drive with a more recent model.
Another Apple fanboy at Computerworld bought a 15-inch Macbook Pro with the 7,200 RPM drive only to suffer from the same problem.
Of course Apple's tame press has been quick to let Jobs' Mob off the hook, muttering about how it is the second time this year that Seagate has had problems with its 7,200 RPM hard drives. The Momentus drive retails at only $141.99 for 500GB, so what do users expect?
Oh, and they paid how much for their Macbook Pros? Âµ
