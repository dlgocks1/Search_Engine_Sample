Caught kissing Chace Crawford, Ashley decides to take a Legal Action.
Well known as a Twilight star Ashley Greene (Ashley Michele Greene) born on February 21, 1987 in Jacksonville, Florida and the 22-years-old future star (Choice Fresh Face Female award winner last night), has just been hit hard right in the face by Perez Hilton who posted her nude pictures on his website.
Ashley is being alleged of a scandalous link with Chace Crawford, as shown in the pictures available now on almost all the celebrities’ websites. Although for a change, an immediate reaction has been observed by the Ashley and her attorney: “The photos in question, which appear to be of our client, are illegal and are being unlawfully displayed. Our client intends to take legal action.”
And it was her attorney who at his earliest, wired Mr. Boom Boom Pow Perez Hilton to immediately cease the display of those unlawful pictures. The material has however been removed from the site, temporarily.
The ‘Vanessa Hudgens’ scandal recently surfaced the web and now it’s Ashley who is feeling the heat. She has been caught kissing Chace Crawford in her limousine, on Monday, August 10. She was heading towards Los Angeles Airport to fly Canada. She is busy in Canada for her new movie named “The Twilight Saga’s Eclipse.”
