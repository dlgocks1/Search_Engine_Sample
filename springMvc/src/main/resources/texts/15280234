We don’t cover a lot of software here at OhGizmo!, but once in a while we come across an app that we feel is worth mentioning. Like Sudoku Grab for the iPhone, which is the perfect tool for those who like to tackle Sudoku puzzles, but never seem to have any success in solving them. You just take a shot of the puzzle using the iPhone’s camera (obviously the 3GS probably provides better results) and the application will automatically solve it in just a few seconds. You can also choose to actually play the puzzle on the iPhone first, once the numbers have all been converted, but why put up with all that frustration? $1 available from the iTunes App Store.
