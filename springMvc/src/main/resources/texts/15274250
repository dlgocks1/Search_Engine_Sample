TruFocals are the revolutionary new glasses that let you choose the perfect focus for every distance from near to far.
Seeing clearly everywhere, from up close to infinity, is finally possible. Wearing TruFocals, with just a simple finger motion on a small slider on the bridge, you can actually go from reading a newspaper to viewing a TV set to scanning a distant vista and your vision is crisp and clear every inch of the way. That’s a major improvement over multifocal glasses that are in focus only at certain fixed distances so your vision between those zones is blurred.
And, with TruFocals, the whole lens is in focus so your entire field of view is sharp, not just a portion as with bifocals or progressive glasses. That means—
no distortion, lines or blurriness anywhere in your field of vision. Vision is as good on the edges as it is in the center.
being able to read an entire newspaper page without having to fold it or bob your head up and down to find the right part of the lenses. With TruFocals, your whole lens is the right part.
greater safety on stairs and curbs where an out-of-focus step can lead to a bad misstep.
You can adjust TruFocals to any distance you want. Whenever you want. Instantly. With TruFocals, you’re in charge.
