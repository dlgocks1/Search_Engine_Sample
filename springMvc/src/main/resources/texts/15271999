This past weekend marked the debut of White Mountaineering’s 2009 fall/winter collection. Forging ahead with a new flagship store, the collection’s awesome technical offerings in a package featuring classic aesthetics is evident with a serious of marquee pieces seen here. As always, their outerwear is the highlight of the collection with materials such as GORE-TEX and GORE-WINDSTOPPER making an appearance. However their collection is also rounded out by shirts, knitwear, pants and footwear. Among the collaborations this season are footwear with Timberland and bags/wallets with Porter.
