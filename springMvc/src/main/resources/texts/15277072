Paddled
I realize I have been sluggish on the updates recently. I have been spending a lot of time over at Transformation Media I have become pretty active in the forums over there. I've met some great people and just been really sidetracked by the forums there. All in good fun though. Now: this update. Thanks to Tina for the image. I couldn't pass writing a caption for this one! Also thanks to Kevin, and Melina for your comments on my last caps.

An Update
No new caps from me today. Expect some in the near future though. I am working on a few and as soon as I finish them I will post them. But in the mean time, this little one was made for me by Bren over at Rachel's Haven. Enjoy!

Be Sure to Always Cleanup
I just love this picture. I wish the story were true, that that was actually me. Oh well, I can always dream can't I? Thanks to Melina and Kevin for your comments on my last caption.

Pay for Your Mistakes
Sorry for the time lapse in updates here. As I have mentioned I am devoting more of my time to bettering my skills at playing the guitar. Since I'm done with school for now I have a lot more free time and being good at playing guitar has always been something I wanted to accomplish. Anyway, I do love this caption. I think the bit of a break gave my mind a refresher and let me come up with new ideas. Thanks to Kevin, Tammi, and Sachi for your comments on my last caption. So until my next caption here, do enjoy this one. :P

Femme Virus Zombies
So I was thinking, what would happen if the Femme Virus got out of control? What would it be like? Femme Zombies came to mind. Mindless Femme Zombies who crave only cocks. Quite a different take on Sachi's original Femme Virus concept, but that's what I do, I like to be different. Thanks again to Sachi for the inspiration and thanks to Lexi and Sport for your comments on my last caption.

Pleasure Fused With Pain
"Pleasure fused with pain" and "power unrestrained" are lyrics to a song I was listening to. I thought they were just the perfect words for a caption, so here it is.

My Weekend Off
I decided to take the whole weekend off and not do anything. I needed to relax and just catch up on some things. Just been watching TV, some movies, music videos, and playing guitar. Haven't played a lot lately and needed to reconnect. I hope to be back tomorrow with some new captions. Until then I did find this video while I was browsing youtube. Just warning you up front that if you don't like death metal, you probably shouldn't watch. Nothing to do with TG. It is a cover of t.A.T.u.'s All the Things She Said by the Australian industrial death metal band The Berzerker. I found it rather enjoyable. Well, til tomorow, be good girls. :P

Training by Crack of the Whip
This one I did for you Melina. You wanted a pony girl one, well here you go. From your comments it sounds like you like pain, so there is some pain in there too. Hope you like it. Thanks to Tammi for the inspiration and comment on my last caption, you still are the best babe. Oh, if you want some pointers on how to make a cap Melina, email me and we'll chat. isobellenichole@yahoo.com

The Dentist
This one is for Tammi. Its some of what we were talking about. I still think it was a brilliant idea for a caption. You should do one too. I know it was your idea, but I couldn't resist, that image in my mind was begging to be let out in caption form.

Up For Auction
Used an animated pic on this one. (Thought I'd let you know, just in case you couldn't tell :P) Seen this pic and the story that came to mind just had to be told, it was too good to let it go. Special thanks goes out to Tammi for her lovey comments.

The Slut of Her Dreams
This one is for you Tammi. Once again thank you dearly for making a cap for me. And continued thanks for your comments. Your comments make me strive to keep making captions and keep pushing myself to see where I can go next. Thank you from the bottom of my heart babe. I really do love exploring the depths of my mind.

New Slaves are the Best
I do love the way this one turned out. This one is for you Falko. Hope you like it. It took awhile to find just the right picture, and this one was perfect. And for the rest of you girls out there do enjoy this one as well, but don't go too crazy now. :P

Son Gets "Fixed"
Another new one. If you noticed I did put up a new blog title picture. I didn't spend much time making the original one and thought I could do better. I think this new one is a bit more fitting for me. More special thanks to Tammi for her continued support and comments.

A Little Bit Nervous
I took a different perspective on this one. I wrote this one though the eyes of the transformee. That was quite an experience. I put myself mentally in the situation and wrote what I felt. Lemme tell you though, if you think reading caps like this gives you awesome feelings, try putting yourself in the shoes of the person in the cap and describing your situation. Wow, that was amazing. Well, hope you enjoy reading this one as much as I did when I wrote it.

A New Patient, A New Friend
This one's not so evil either, but whatever. Feeling generous I guess. Thanks to Tammi for another great comment, you're the best, you really give me inspiration to keep making more caps. Love ya, babe.

Filling Her Up
I'm not feeling as evil today. Tracie is having a good transformation, albeit still forced. I do love love coming up with new and different ways to transform someone though. :) Thanks to Jennifer for the comment on my last cap. And to Tammi, thanks again for another encouraging comment. You make me feel very appreciated and I love you for that dear.

We've Created a Monster
This one gets pretty violent toward the end. By far the most horrific one I've done yet, I think. I've been listening to a lot of Cannibal Corpse today, so I guess this is the result when you combine death metal with these captions. Oh well. I thought it was a different idea. Anyway, I think that's enough of writing caps for today, this one makes four. Two for here and two for my other blog.

Two Dollar Whore
This one turned out to be a little extreme. Definitely unconventional surgical procedures. But extreme transformations are quite entertaining for me, a little arousing too. Ohh I'm feeling naughty today. Thanks to wannabecumslut and Tammi Heartilly for the comments on my Pony Girl cap.

Turned into a Pony Girl
Ahh, the pony girl. A fantasy I've had for quite some time, though this cap takes it a step further. Thanks to Lexi and Tammi Heartilly for the lovely and encouraging comments on my last two caps. And to Falko - I'll see what I can do in making a cap for you. Also what do you all think of the font I am using. Is it easy to read or should I change it? I was trying to go for something evil-ish looking and that's what I found (good 'ol AC/DC font).

The Final Surgery
Being evil is fun! Especially being an evil mistress who turns men into women for her own sick pleasure of seeing their horror as they're transformed. Hehe.

Nurse Rita
I'm feeling very devious today, so here's another. Thanks to Sport for the comment, its good to embrace your dark side and see where it goes. Being good all the time gets boring. A special thanks to Tammi Heartilly, I do love all the work you do. And I'm glad to have started this blog, cause I think I like this side of me.

Well, there's my first truly forced femme caption. William went through a lot of pain, but he sure turned out beautiful. Hehe. :)

You Don't Know the Power of the Dark Side
This is a new blog I'm starting. It differs from my other blog in that the caps here will generally be of forced feminization. These will be of a much darker nature. Again my main goal is to have fun with this.
