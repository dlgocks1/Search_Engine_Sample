Fireplaces aren't supposed to be sexy pieces of furniture in the home, but the Mall Fire takes a different approach. It looks like a standard trunk on the outside, but opening it up will reveal a portable fireplace to help keep you and your family warm during those bitterly cold winters. The firebox comes with a mirror within, letting you soothe and relax the evening away by watching flames dancing acorss the mirror. When not in use to keep folks warm, it doubles up as a piece of furniture. The portable fireplace will retail for a whooping $5,395.
