My main desktop is 7 or 8 years old and has never been
reinstalled. dpkg
has become so slow that I started to shy away from using it, e.g.
to purge packages. Not good.
I always suspected that it was due to
/var/lib/dpkg/status, the ever-growing
dpkg status “database”^W plain-text file,
which the programme had to scan multiple times per run, and I
sought a means to compact it, and by that I meant:
dpkg --compact
or similar to remove the stanzas for purged packages. There is
--forget-old-unavail, but that only cleans out
uninstalled packages that are no longer available (I
think), whereas I’d really rather get rid of knowledge of
all uninstalled packages. Who needs that information if you don’t
use --get-selections and
--set-selections?
While I was still huffing about the absence of such a
command-line option, and inspecting a bug report about auto-cleaning
the status database of purged packages, Gerfried Fuchs got to the matter
and suggested to run (needs grep-dctrl, sudo and moreutils
installed):
grep-status -! -FStatus 'purge ok not-installed' \
| sudo sponge /var/lib/dpkg/status
That shrunk the file by about 10%, which didn’t impress me, and
so I continued to complain…
… until it struck me that the speed increase from removing what
must have amounted to hundreds of purged package stanzas was
enormous.
Highly recommended — until dpkg does better
housekeeping. Looks like 
that will be the case with the next version. Then the above
method will be good for a one-time spring-cleaning before
dpkg starts living a tidier life.
