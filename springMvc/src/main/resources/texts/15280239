Motorola's MOTONAV GC550 recently made an appearance in a filing to the FCC which includes a bunch of external photos, the full manual as well as tests. This touchscreen device is tipped to support 3D mapping, boasting voice commands, Bluetooth connectivity to compatible handsets for hands-free use, a microSD memory card slot, Google local search support, as well as the latest updates on weather, traffic and flights. Too bad there is no word on pricing or a release date, so hopefully Motorola can rectify that on their end in the near future.
