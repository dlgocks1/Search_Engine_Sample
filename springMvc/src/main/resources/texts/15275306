Tom (and Chalmers), Have you guys read Russ Baker's Family of Secrets? All of it? He's pretty thorough on these issues. He answers your angst-ridden questions about cost and the necessity of building an empire pretty easily. You've got to understand (and then act on the knowledge about) who is really making the calls. It's not the American taxpayers guys (or the much-loved progressive candidate Obama). Turns out we're all working for the bankstas. Love you both! S
