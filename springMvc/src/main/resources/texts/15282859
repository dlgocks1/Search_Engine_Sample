To help me better manage things, this brush set has been moved to my =Falln-Stock account. You can find the New Download here! - [link] ------------------- The Brushes here are made by me for Photoshop. *they may not work with older versions of Photoshop they were made with Photoshop CS* They are free to use, just give me credit for making them in the description of your picture. Do not claim them as your own, or redistribute them. Note me with a link to the picture you have used them in, i would love to see what you can do!
