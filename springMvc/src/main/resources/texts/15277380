It is my husband's birthday this weekend so I designed some birthday cards! Please enjoy these FREE PRINTABLE "Happy Birthday Babe" and "Happy Birthday Love" A2 folded cards. The stripe pattern continues onto the back of the card. The PDF has one card of each. Just print on 8.5x11 cardstock, trim down the center line, and fold each card in half. Maybe try printing on color or simple patterned paper! Get creative! Have a great weekend everyone!
