Many will agree that Judy Garland's performance of "Over The Rainbow", in the 1939 film classic "The Wizard of Oz", is truly a magical moment in American cinema. Written by Harold Arlen / music and E. Y. Harburg / lyrics, this timeless classic has been covered by many artists. More info on this song is posted on wikipedia. I've always enjoyed "Over The Rainbow" but I 
never thought of performing it until seeing several versions on youtube. I've worked out this simple arrangement that stays close to the Garland version. Hearing Garland's version after I made this clip, I realized I changed a note and word or two. As the wizard says, "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain." Enjoy. - FK
Note to music readers and tabbies: I play by ear and I don't use, nor have, written transcriptions of anything I play.
