If response to this is good, I'm thinking of making a version from the point of view of Kyon as well (i.e. same thing, but inside the anime). Let me know if you wanna see it. ^^

A time in the not-so-distant future ...
Well, I'd like to bet on Endless Eight being nine episodes. If KyoAni wants to go all-out and not have to animate 15,000 episodes, nine is probably the best number.
I'm enjoying it anyway. Despite how irresistable I found this concept, I actually like Endless Eight a lot. Perhaps because a lot of people are reacting like our friend Hitler here.
I can kind of sympathize ... but the fact that KyoAni is pulling off this kind of stunt just entertains me to no end. It provides amusement both inside and outside the show - just watching the plummeting rating on MAL tells me I'm watching something special.
It's that insane Diethard-esque grin on my face that keeps me going. That look that knows I'm seeing something that's probably once-in-a-lifetime. Maybe for a good reason ... maybe not.
We shall see.
Some longer posts I have discussing the matter:
