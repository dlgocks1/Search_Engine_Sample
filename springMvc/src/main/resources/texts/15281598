So when I like something, I tend to REALLY LIKE it. One of my great likes is the Brooklyn-based performance group What We Know So Far. They focus on Internety/geeky/memey things and give a really entertaining and clever show. In just 2 days, New Yorkers will have the chance to see Not One, Not Two, But Three of their performance pieces at the Third Ward.
So what I am saying is that if you are in like an 80 mile radius, you should go.
If you miss it, that is sort of ok as we are hosting them at NYU on October 9th.
