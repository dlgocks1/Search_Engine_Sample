If you happen to be both a Star Wars fan and have a penchant for Far Eastern food, this new gadget might be the right thing for you: lightsaber chopsticks. A Japanese company called Kotobukiya (which also has a US website) is selling three different models.
The red version is aimed at Darth Vader fans for some reason, the green one is for Yoda fans and the blue model is supposedly the right one if you like Luke Skywalker best.
Kotobukiya plans to sell the chopsticks in Japan only at this point (starting in November), but Geek Stuff 4 U lets everybodyÂ  living outside this country pre-order already (price: $14.42 plus shipping). And yes, you can eat with these things apparently.
