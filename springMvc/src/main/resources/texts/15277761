Around 221,000 fans attended the three games on the U.S. west coast."We are opening an important market, we have sealed a contract with our sponsors there for three years. We are committed to returning because Barca are taking off in the USA," club director Joan Boix said."We will have made between 5-6 million euros. We have more than exceeded our estimates."There is an immediate impact which is the income from the tour, and in the medium term there is the goodwill generated for the Barca brand in a country as important as the U.S.."Barcelona returned from San Francisco on Sunday and have a week to prepare for the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Athletic Bilbao at San Mames next Sunday.(Writing by Mark Elkington; Editing by John O'Brien)
