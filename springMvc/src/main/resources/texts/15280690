Verbatim has revealed its latest Tuff-Clip USB drive that was specially designed to be clipped onto one's belt loop, offering much more convenience compared to what a standard USB flash drive can. This ruggedized drive is constructed using ABS plastic, and you won't have to worry about losing a cap anymore thanks to the retractable cap design. Available in 4GB and 8GB capacities, the Verbatim Tuff-Clip USB drive has a data retention rate of around 10 years, by which that time you would most probably have ported all data stored there to another platform, right?
