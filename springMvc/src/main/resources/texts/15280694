The MagLevAir airplane shuttle system could be the future of air travel if done correctly - after all, who doesn't want reduced noise, space and energy consumption when traveling? The airplane itself is connected to a maglev shuttle that reduces cost during take off by saving on expensive cerosin for acceleration. The delta wing shaped airplane will rely on scram jets in flight, where the entire aircraft is part of a hub and spoke system. It is also flexible in theory, serving in urban environments as well as transporting passengers across short distances to bigger airports. Guess it will be decades before something like this even gets a whiff of entering our reality.
