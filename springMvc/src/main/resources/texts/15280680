Optoma has just unveiled their latest home theater projector known as the HD20. This model will come with a brightness rating of 1,700 ANSI lumens, a 4,000:1 contrast ratio and full HD resolution support. Don't think that it is going to cost you a bomb though since the Optoma HD20 will retail for a mere $999, bringing affordable high definition home entertainment to a wider demographic as it is more than capable of throwing a screen size larger than 120". Other connectivity options include dual HDMI ports, composite, component and a VGA port.
