Haeundae beach in Pusan, S. Korea 
First week of August that is the public holidays for all Koreans, the beach gets overcrowded. Some people spend their entire holidays on the beach!!! 
Very few people use swimming dresses, mostly they keep their clothes on while swimming. 
You can see a latet photo of the beach, 6 years later, not much has changed:
