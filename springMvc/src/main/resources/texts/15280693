Sprint's upcoming Samsung Dash has just been approved by the FCC, and apart from that, we don't really have too much information on a smartphone that runs on CDMA frequencies and is also known as the M850 if you prefer to refer to handsets by their model number. EV-DO, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity alongside a microSD memory card slot is all we have on this handset. Guess there is always the official announcement to look forward to in the near future, eh?
