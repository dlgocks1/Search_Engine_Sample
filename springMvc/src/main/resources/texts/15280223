As if its Sci-Fi parking garage wasn't cool enough, VW's now built this amazing exhibition for its Autostadt attraction in Wolfsburg, Germany. The 1000m2 space has 25 installations exploring three aspects of sustainability: the environment, society, and the economy.
Level Green opened on June 4 this year, and was built by Berlin architects, J Mayer H, and designed by Art+Com. They took design cues from the PET recycle logo, and built the complex structures using wood composite sheets reinforced with steel, and sprayed with acrylic-based car paint.
The installations include touch-sensitive screens mounted on vertical surfaces that provide info on the various displays and models. [Autostadt (translated) via Deezen]
