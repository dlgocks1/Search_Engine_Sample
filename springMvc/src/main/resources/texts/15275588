NFG loves fonts. It's a sad little addiction that brought him to this: a page that allows you to create your own images, with words of your choosing, using fonts unceremoniously ripped from beloved arcade games of yore. Please use it only for evil (or whimsy). Also, if you happen to find this useful, please tell your friends.
