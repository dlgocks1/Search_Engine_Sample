Love going for karaoke sessions? The Karaoke mute microphone works directly opposite to what a standard microphone does, as it offers a cone-of-silence around the microphone itself so that all you hear on your headphones is your voice, while neighbors won't know any better that you've just busted your lungs out for the last 2 hours, belting out hit after hit on the karaoke machine. This USB-connected device is 100% compatible with the Nintendo Wii.
