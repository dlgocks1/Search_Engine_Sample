WhereCampMTL
There is a WhereCampMTL (Montr√©al, QC, Canada) in the works for October 23rd 2009, right after the Geomatique 2009 conference. Contact Sylvain Carle for more info (sc@praized.com or @afrognthevalley).
WhereCamp5280
WhereCamp5280 (or WhereCamp1609m for the Canadians) will be in the Mile High City, Denver, Colorado, at the University of Denver campus August 14th and 15th.
WhereCamp 2009
Wherecamp 2009 happened May 22-23rd in Palo Alto. See the Friday Grid and Saturday Grid for links to some shared notes.
Here's a nice map by Christine Bush to help find the meeting rooms WhereCampus2009_Friday_map.pdf
What is WhereCamp?
WhereCamp is the unconference for geohackers and WhereCampWiki is where it all goes down. We use the wiki as the centralized place for communicating all of the final information about WhereCamp. The most recent WhereCamp was WhereCamp 2009.
What kind of people will be there?
You might see folks like this:
Where 2.0 GeoWankers 2007
Where 2.0 GeoWankers 2008
How do I help out?
If you are interested in helping plan, please join the WhereCamp mailing list on Yahoo! Groups so you can join in on the planning aspect.
If you are more into real-time conversation you will also be able to find most of the planners and attendees in #geo (irc.oftc.net).
The popular mailing list where most of the social mapping folks hang out is of course geowanking and you will want to be on that list anyway if you are not already.
We will also be making relevant noises on http://twitter.com/wherecamp as things start to happen.

Who should attend?
Calling all Geohackers, geowhackers and geoslackers -- its free to attend so why not? Be sure to signup so we can get an idea for numbers and so that you get a kick ass tshirt.
What is a WhereCamp event like?
WhereCamps are built on the ideas originally put forth by FooCamp, except that attendance is open to anyone. It is an unconference,where the attendees drive the content of the sessions the day of instead of having a prescribed schedule and set of content. Therefore, the event is what you make of it, and is only as fun as the people who attend. So be prepared to speak and contribute. If you're still not sure, then read up on the original FooCamp.
