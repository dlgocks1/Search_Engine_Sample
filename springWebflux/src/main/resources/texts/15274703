The l sound is created by lightly pressing the tip of your tongue to the front or middle of your tooth ridge while keeping your tongue blade and back of your tongue held low. Your lips should be relaxed when producing this sound. Native speakers of some languages (including many languages of India) place the tip of their tongue farther back, creating a more hollow sound and prohibiting a smooth release of the sound. This is called retroflexing, and should be avoided during the l sound. Native speakers of Asian languages tend to raise the back of their tongue too far, as English speakers do when creating the r sound. This makes it difficult for a native speaker to hear the difference between the l sound and r sound when spoken by a person with an Asian native language.
The most common difficulties in minimal pairs with the l sound are the r sound and the w sound.
