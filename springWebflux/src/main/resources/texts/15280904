APPLE'S belief that its employees should work just for the joy of labouring within Steve Jobs' aura was confirmed this week when a former employee sued the outfit for unpaid overtime.
Kenyon Zahner has filed a class action lawsuit against Apple, complaining that the Mac maker forces its employees to work long hours without overtime pay.
He normally worked more than 40 hours per week at an Apple location in Florida but was surprised that the outfit didn't pay him for the time.
Under State Law, however, overtime is required for non-managerial employees. Zahner's attorneys stated in the legal documents filed in the US District Court in Florida that "The defendant knowingly had the plaintiff work off the clock and did not pay the plaintiff overtime."
There is little information about the suit. It appears that Zahner is a Mac technician. His actual hours are still in the process of being 'discovered' by the legal process.
The lawyers are seeking unspecified damages on behalf of Zahner and other Apple employees in Florida who were allegedly cheated out of overtime pay.
Apple is by no means the first computer outfit to be hit by this law. IBM had to dole out $65 million in 2006 for similar claims. In 2005, Outsourcer Computer Sciences paid $24 million to settle similar allegations.
Apple has yet to say anything about the complaint. We guess Zahner can just be thankful that he does not work for one of Apple's Chinese contractors. Âµ
