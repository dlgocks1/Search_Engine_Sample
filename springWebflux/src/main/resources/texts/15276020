“Notes and Domino Applications just don't break” Developer, LCTY Cincinatti
8.5 Application Development Themes
 Provide developers with a modern development
tool IDE
Do for developers what Notes 8 did for end users
– Improve usability and productivity
– Address various developer pain points from previous
versions
Attract new developers to the platform
 The Web Has Never looked better
Allow developers to build attractive, modern web apps
that leverage Web 2.0 technologies with less work
Provide means to incrementally update existing
Domino Web applications
Domino 8.5 –Introducing XPages
 What are XPages?
– A new design element for Domino Designer
– A runtime designed to generate modernWeb applications
 Brings State-of-the-Art Web technology to Domino 8.5
– Leverages Java Server Face based, proven Java runtime,
from Lotus Component Designer
– XPages are designed for generating modern Web
applications
• Built-in Web 2.0 features
 Solves problems expressed by the Domino community
– Known limitations are addressed
• UI/data separation, HTML generation control, server state,
localization, extensibility, etc.
– Same modern rendering technology can target multiple
clients
"We finished our target goal too quickly so
we had time to add unplanned functionality"
TJ Witte - Salesplace.com "Equivalent transactions that were taking a full
second (or more) to complete in a Java agent are
now completing in 20 - 40 milliseconds. And we
haven't even optimized it yet to use any explicit
scope caching; that 50x performance boost is just
from running it in a servlet context instead of in
agents"
"XPage technology drastically reduces the time it
takes us to develop Domino applications. We no Tim Tripcony - Lotus 911
longer need to spend time developing client side
JavaScript/Ajax code since many of things we built in
this manner are now core features of XPages.
Additionally, the ability to more easily leverage
standard techniques like CSS makes building a
compelling user experience much easier." ...People had a good feeling of what they saw. They
appreciated that 'Cloud' widget, and the good look &
Bruce Elgort - Eljugi software llc feel already provided...
...Some were already asking when we could deliver
the first eLite running with xPages.”
