My name is Nick Campbell and greyscalegorilla is my photoblog. I currently live in Chicago and work at Digital Kitchen as a Motion Designer. The daily photos allow me to explore composition and design, while also acting as a journal of my existence here in Chicago and elsewhere. The blog was started to post links to ideas, news, and inspiration and for creatives and creators and to show some behind the scenes into my process in photography and motion design. Thanks for visiting.
