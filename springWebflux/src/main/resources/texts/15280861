A court has heard that the gang which murdered two soldiers in County Antrim accidentally recorded themselves 'gloating' about the attack.Details of the mobile phone recording were revealed during a bail application by one of the men charged with the murders, according to the Irish News. Sappers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey were shot dead outside Masserene Barracks on 7 March. Brian Shivers (44), of Sperrin Mews in Magherafelt was refused bail. The paper reports that two mobile phones were among several items recovered by police from the car which is believed to have been used to carry out the shooting. Overalls, balaclavas and bullets matching those which were used by the killers were also recovered from the Vauxhall Cavalier which was found near Randalstown, shortly after the attack. During the recorded conversation, one member of the gang is alleged to have said: "There's a few dead alright." Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Real IRA. Colin Duffy from Lurgan has also been charged with the murders.
