CL-GTK2 is a Common Lisp GUI library that provides access to the Gtk+ cross-platform GUI library in idiomatic Lisp style.
CL-GTK2 should portably work in most modern Lisps that support CFFI and MOP (see Compatibility).
Messages regarding development, feature requests, bug reports should be posted to cl-gtk2-devel mailing list.
clgtk2 blog contains news on development of CL-GTK2.
Features:
Provides Gtk+ API in a Lispy way
(Almost) Complete Gtk+ API
Objects and classes are mapped into CLOS objects and classes
Gtk+ objects are garbage collected
Error in objects' signal handlers are restartable
Provides some higher-level abstractions over Gtk+ facilities:
Calling code in GUI thread (call-within-main-loop, call-within-main-loop-and-wait)
Displaying progress-bar for long-running code (with-progress-bar)
Displaying errors (with-gtk-message-error-handler)
CL-GTK2 is not yet complete. To do:
Better implementation of type mapping Done
Change weak references to toggle references
Better support for subclassing objects and defining GObject classes implemented in lisp
Complete API binding
Support for wide range of Lisp compilers and interpreters
Support for Gtk+ on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X
Write documentation and tutorial
High-level API for user interface building
An introductory screencast
Changes:
2009.08.08. Rewrote GBoxed type mapping.
2009.07.18. Added GObject documentation to the site.
