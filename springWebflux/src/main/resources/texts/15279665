Resource Page Description We have posted a number of samples which are available to assist developers with coding against the Network List Manager (NLM) APIs for aplication development on both Windows Vista and Windows 7. The samples describe how to use the API set to obtain network connectivity information as needed and how to register for events so that applications can take react to changing state of networking connectivity. Samples are provided for both C++ and C# development. The NLM API reference is available at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370803(VS.85).aspx.
