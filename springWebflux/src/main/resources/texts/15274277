GeoDjango Database API¶
GeoDjango’s lookup types may be used with any manager method like
filter(), exclude(), etc. However, the lookup types unique to
GeoDjango are only available with geographic fields.
Filters on ‘normal’ fields (e.g. CharField) may be chained with those on
geographic fields. Thus, geographic queries take the following form (assuming
the Zipcode model used in the GeoDjango Model API):
>>> qs = Zipcode.objects.filter(<field>__<lookup_type>=<parameter>)
>>> qs = Zipcode.objects.exclude(...)
