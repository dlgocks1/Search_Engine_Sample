Memory declines with age, but if you'd like to remember where you placed your keys well into your golden years, try implementing a 30-second daily eye exercise.
Video how-to site Howcast provides some tips on how to improve memory. Among the more simple suggestions is to start each morning out with an eye exercise. The goal is to get both sides of your brain to work together, achieved simply by moving your eyes side-to-side for 30 seconds before going about your day's activities. 
The video also suggests memorizing information on an empty stomach. Why? "The hormone that improves the memory is highest when the stomach is empty" (though we'd add that if you're too hungry, you might not be able to focus at all). 
Hit up the video for the full list of tips, then check out our previous post for an explanation on why ten minutes of daily chatter can also help improve your mind.
