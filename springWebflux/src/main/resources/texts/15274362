Collection of very odd and bizarre looking fountains from around the world everyone should see.While collecting the pictures for a post about strange sculptures I discovered some very bizarre and odd looking fountains and I really wanted to share it with you. Some of them looked a bit shocking when I first saw them, but after 1 hour of working on this post, cropping, uploading and optimizing the pictures, my eyes became so numb that I can hardly tell my opinion about them. So please share your thoughts in the comments and tell me what  you think of these strange fountains.
