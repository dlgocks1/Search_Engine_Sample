Cellar Heat is a wordpress theme by evaneckard designs. I really liked the themes design for a sweetcron life stream.
Sweetcron is a free and open source solution for creating a self-hosted Lifestream; a blog-like website that shows your activity across the various websites you visit, entirely automatically.
Since there arent very much free sweetcron themes available yet (only theme i know is a theme aailable at sweetcronthemes.com) , i thought of sweetcroning it. Took me like 4 hours to accomplish the mission. Looks good i guess. 
Tutorial
Please Download the Theme to continue (Cellar Heat – A Free Sweetcron theme for download)
Upload the contents of the theme to sweetcron themes folder. (/system/application/views/themes/)
Go to your sweetcron admin pannel (/admin), log in and chose cellar heat theme.
Now its time to setup comments. I prefer DISQUS, i tried some other commenting systems, but they makes page load really slow.
After signing up click “Add Website” can be found on the top right corner.
Fill the form and and as you reach the page saying Website Integration, select “Generic Code” from the drop down box.
Copy the code snippet #1. 
Open comments.php file with some code editor or notepad and replace the “Use DISQUS commenting code here.” with the copied code snippet #1. It should look like this when done. 
Open “_activity_feed.php” and goto line no.39. It will be as follows
<span class="lower-meta"><a href="<?php echo $item->get_permalink()?>/<?php echo $item->get_name()?>" title="Comments">Comments</a></span>
Paste #disqus_thread just after ?>/<?php echo $item->get_name()?>. The Final Code should look like this.
<span class=”lower-meta”><a href=”<?php echo $item->get_permalink()?>/<?php echo $item->get_name()?>#disqus_thread
" title="Comments">Comments</a></span>
Copy the code snippet #2 from disqus page and paste it on the same line (No.39) replacing the “Comments”. The final code set should look like this. 
Pasting this code will show the number of comments posted in that particular item on the front page.
Now you are done. Re upload the two edited files. That should do.
If you are using this theme please post your link here as a comment. And enjoy.
