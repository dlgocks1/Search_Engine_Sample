An anon was kind enough to introduce me to the superb 3D CG artist whose works we saw when looking at the state of 3D Haruhi games; going by the name of 北仙 / Hokusen, with his site/circle called “Feel Myself”, he possesses notable skill in rendering anime characters in 3D, and his works are well worth a look, both for their artistic merits, and as a sign of things to come.
You’ll also notice he has a singular predilection for creating interesting Haruhi images…
I have placed these fine images on the Channel, where he now has a tag; please feel free to help tagging them.
You are of course encouraged to visit his homepage.
Not much information is offered, so providing you with much information on him is not possible; he does mention the software he uses: LightWave, Photoshop, Premiere After Effects, openCanvas.
Sadly, he has not gone far in exploring the possibilities offered by animating his great creations, although for all we know this is his day job.
