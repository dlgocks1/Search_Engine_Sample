Most of us delve into the virtual world to get a dose of what we normally can't do in the real world, including shooting up aliens with sophisticated new weapons from the military, but here's taking a 180-degree turn from that idea. Developers from Waterloo Labs managed to come up with a new system that enables participants to be involved in a FPS using real guns. This is made possible thanks to a similar version of high tech shadow boxing, where a piece of dry wall is rigged with a quartet of accelerometers. Whenever the bullet hits the wall from a gun, it will emit a tiny shock wave which can then be calculated to triangulate the exact point where the bullet hit.
