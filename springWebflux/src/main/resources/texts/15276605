from Monty Python's Flying Circus
Season 1 - Episode 09 
The Ant, An Introduction
Recorded 07-12-69, Aired 14-12-69
It starts with the "Homicidal Barber" who we then discover to be the cross-dressing jolly-singing lumberjack wannabe... 
To wrap things up, Gumby shows off his incredibly talented crooning... Very touching! 
Touching indeed!
I'm slowly uploading the entire Flying Circus series... Got any requests?
