a little animation project i started this past weekend, inspired by the wonderful music of Olafur Arnalds. 
the song is called Ljósið, and you can listen it at: 
thesixtyone.com/olafurarnalds/ 
There you will find a few more songs by the artist, and they're all incredibly beautiful and haunting. 
the quotes are from many sources, including Brian Eno, Stefan Segmeister, Albert Einstein and a few more i got randomly and i'm not sure about the author. In all cases, thank you for the inspiration.
