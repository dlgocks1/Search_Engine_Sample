Gesamtkunstwerk (German for the universal artwork) was a term first popularized by the German composer Richard Wagner, and is also the title of Artemio’s current exhibit over at Yautepec Gallery in Mexico City. In it, Artemio presented 18 50×50cm digital prints on canvas and one relief, which show perfect snowflake-like compositions made of guns, grenades, rifles and machetes. 
These works are a response to a study published in early 2009 by the United States Joint Forces Command, which grouped Mexico with Pakistan as “two large and important states [that] bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse,” due to Mexico’s inability to combat drug trade and violence within their own borders.
