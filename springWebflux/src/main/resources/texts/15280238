Seems as though the Motorola Morrison's specifications list was just leaked out, and judging by what we know, it will be powered by a 528MHz Qualcomm processor alongside 256MB RAM, placing it pretty much on par with the HTC G1, myTouch and Hero smartphones. This would mean it is a lower-end smartphone, so hopefully the engineers at Motorola will be able to do their bit by coming up with a customized verison of the Android user interface in order to make a larger impact when the Morrison is released, as Motorola surely wouldn't want another dud in their recent dismal track record, do they?
