Macross Frontier has some of the best music I've heard in any anime, and Ranka[green hair] and Sheryl[pinkish blonde hair] are just so cute. I couldn't resist making this video - this is one of my favorite songs! It's definitely the best of the duets, and the scene where they sing in front of Alto is just too funny. His face when he realizes, "S***, I've got to choose between the two most famous girls in the galaxy" cracks me up. Anyway, I cut out the end of the song. Don't ask why, even I don't know. I think maybe it was because I wanted it to end after a refrain, not randomly. Who knows? HD really takes up a lot of space. The file was 138mb, even though it is .wmv
I apologize for that. It may take a while to load. The song is What 'Bout My Star, from the Macross Frontier OST. Vocals are... Ranka and Sheryl?
