Yesterday Playfish stated that the company had installed 100 million games during the 18 month period since the company's launch, according to Gamasutra. The 100 million installs are across seven titles in the Playfish portfolio, including Pet Society, Restaurant City, Minigolf Party, Bowling Buddies, Who Has the Biggest Brain?, World Challenge, and Geo Challenge. Playfish's games are played primarily through social network sites like Facebook, MySpace, and Bebo. Right now the company also claims 30 million monthly active users across its games, with 12 million alone coming from its biggest hit, Pet Society. Right now Pet Society has over 1 million fans on Facebook and is one of the fastest-growing third party apps available on the site. The company took $17 million in venture capital in 2008 from Accel Partners and Index Ventures, which it intended to spend on growing its presence in the social gaming scene. The company has unquestionably succeeded, though it would be very interesting to see what kind of ARPU those 100 million installs generated.
