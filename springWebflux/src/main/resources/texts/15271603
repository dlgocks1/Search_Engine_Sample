This script takes the currently selected effects and creates new versions that are linked to the original 'master' effects using expressions. Copy/paste these new 'linked' effects around your project, then when you change a value on one of the master effects, that value will also change on all linked versions in the project. Download CreateLinkedEffects_v1.2.zip Note: This script requires After Effects 6.5 or later. -------------- How it works : 1/Select an effect on a layer in TLW or the ECW 2/Apply the script 3/The dialog box to select your options (in this case I left it at the default settings) 4/The result in the TLW 5/And the expressions that were created. Now you can copy the linked effects and paste them wherever needed.
