Recently I finally received the needed info from A Mennucc1, the author and maintainer of debdelta(1) utility. Debdelta suite can download the delta between two versions of the same package and reconstruct the target .deb. Currently provided infrastructure allows to use deltas for a) Debian security updates b) Debian testing c) Debian unstable. In Cupt 0.5.2, I managed to add a "download method" uses debdelta to obtain a .deb. To enable it, just install the 'debdelta' package. For the cases when delta is very big, servers don't provide it, so the debdelta method will instantly fail with a 'HTTP 404' message (delta is not available), and Cupt will download the full package as usual.
