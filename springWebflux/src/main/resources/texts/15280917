GATEWAY is planning a brand relaunch and it is going for the top end of the cultural market with a new campaign motto "NO BULL$#!% We're Back!"
The company plans to introduce five notebook models.
Acer bought the outfit for $710 million in 2007 but said it wanted to keep Gateway as a stand-alone brand. Gateway says its main competitors are Toshiba and HP.
The first model introduced is called the Summer Breeze Collection. It features an 11.6-inch high-definition display with built in Wi-Fi, webcam and Dolby Headphone technology.
The Winter Snow Collection NV Series has a silver trim, rounded edges and capacitive-touch launch keys. It comes with Dolby Sound Room technology and can play multimedia content.
The Spring Butterfly Collection EC Series has a an eight-hour battery life on a single charge and has a thin, lightweight design. It also has power-saving settings, data back-up capability and a touchpad lock.
The Autumn Shade Collection ID Series contains a 15.6-inch LED, backlit, frameless widescreen display.
Presumably these names were dreamt up by some marketer who didn't know about the "NO Bull$#!%" campaign.
Gateway will also release the P Series FX, aimed at the high-end gaming, video-editing and graphic-design market. It has a storage capacity of 1TB.
Generally the price range of the Gateway gear is from cheap as chips to the "Oh my god that is even more expensive than an Apple". NO BULL$#!% Âµ
