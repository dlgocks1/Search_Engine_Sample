High street collaborations always get us worked into a frenzy, but when we heard that Jil Sander was working with Uniqlo on a range, our reaction even surprised us. For this is the woman who has had us coveting the perfect cashmere sweater, the ideal grey flannel trousers and the wear-forever black coat. We couldn't splash out on her synonymous label back in the '90s, and then she left her brand five years ago, so we have been a bit lost without her. Finally she's back and we have a first look at her +J collection for Uniqlo, and it is every bit as minimalistic and effortlessly cool as we would expect. Masculine shirts in white, pale pink and lilac; tiny skirts; the aforementioned ideal trousers; and many brilliant coats, which – if we do manage to get our hands on them – we will be wearing forever. The line is apparently made up of 140 pieces, and while prices are yet to be confirmed, expect them to stay within the usual Uniqlo mark. So when do we need to start forming an orderly queue? Well, so far all Uniqlo is saying is ‘fall', which means autumn to you and me. Don't worry though, as soon as we know we will, of course, bring it straight to you.
