If you're paranoid about getting your iPhone wet to the point of sacrificing all coolness, then check this case out. It work for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G and should keep your phone safe from water damage (and we know how sensitive the thing is...). As the photo shows, it's still possible to connect speakers/earplugs to the iPhone and of course, the touch display still works behind the protective plastic layer. Where would you use this?
