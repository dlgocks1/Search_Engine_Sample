Fun with SourceForge.net updates
Recently, SourceForge.net has updated their release system. The
change does not seem to be that bad (besides the fact that people
got used to the old system and need to learn something new), but
the change completely broke their RSS exports for file
releases.
But hey, you have freedom of choice! You can either use old RSS
feeds, which are not
being updated or new RSS feeds, which duplicate
same data for all entries. Sorry, these links require
login.
At the end I've found a way - you can download whole
project RSS, where you ignore most content, but get just the
file names and then download separately 
RSS for each file. And now you have complete data!
