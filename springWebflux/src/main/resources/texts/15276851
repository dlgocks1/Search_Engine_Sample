Above: This is the cover for a launch issue
which would explore the issue of
"Hijaab." 
I conceived a magazine that would be
able to challenge global preconceptions
and misconceptions on heavy issues,
ranging from religious issues like the
Headscarf or political issues like the
return of Soviet Russia, all aimed at a
18-25 year old demographic. 
Above: Article which explores reactions of the public to those who wear the headscarf, with some humorous results. 
Images were integral to making this
magazine that bit more digestible for my
target demographic as they would break
up the columns of information, as well
as a spacious layout and light weight
typeface. 
This article explores how some girls were forced to wear the headscarf
or veil and the resulting effect it has had on their relationship with
their family and their faith. 
Each article will open with a calligraphic title, in this case, I
created four Arabic fonts which can be used in various contexts and
formats.
