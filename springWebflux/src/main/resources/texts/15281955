As the FriendFeed engineers prepare to roll up their sleeves and get to work on improving Facebook, Facebook’s existing team has announced that their new, improved search facility is being rolled out to all users.
Until now only a small group of users were able to test the new Search, which makes it easier to filter different types of content from your friends and any public content from other users. As is de-rigeur these days, it’s realtime which should go a long way to making Facebook seem more ‘alive’ than it currently does.
In a blog post, Facebook’s Akhil Wable says:
“You now will be able to search the last 30 days of your News Feed for status updates, photos, links, videos and notes being shared by your friends and the Facebook Pages of which you’re a fan. If people have chosen to make their content available to everyone, you also will be able to search for their status updates, links and notes, regardless of whether or not you are friends. Search results will continue to include people’s profiles as well as relevant Facebook Pages, groups and applications.”
If it wasn’t for yesterday’s acquisition, we’d say that this was another example of Facebook copying FriendFeed. As it is, it’s just a nice bonus for Facebook users. The new Search facility is being rolled out now but not all users have it yet. If you’re still stuck with the old version of Search, expect to see the new one within the next 48 hours or so.
