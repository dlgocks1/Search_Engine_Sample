I've already got Fedora 10 and want to upgrade to Fedora 11. How do I upgrade my computer from Fedora Linux 10 to Fedora Linux 11? 
Fedora 11 can be directly upgraded over the Internet using the various methods available. Backup all your data (/home and other directories), config file and sql files. Use tools such as rsync or tar to make backup to CD / DVD or other server.
Login as root user to perform upgrade.
WARNING! It is not possible to upgrade directly from Fedora 9 to Fedora 11. To upgrade Fedora 9 to Fedora 11, upgrade to Fedora 10 first. Make sure you backup imporant data before using the information provided below. Also, the yum update step should NOT be run inside a gnome / kdep desktop session/gnome-terminal. It could result in a unusable install when gnome-terminal segfaults during the upgrade. Update should be run in a vty, runlevel 3, or a screen session.
