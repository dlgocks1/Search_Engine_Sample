When you gaze at 31-year-old Mexican photographer Jamie Martinez’s work, you are instantly transported to another world, like Alice through the rabbit hole. Using an old school 3D camera, Martinez shoots sweaty concert scenes or romantic garden shots; the output (formatted in .gif files) is grainy yet devlishly hypnotic. Some background scoop on Martinez is below (via Dazed Digital):
DD: Your animated gifs add an interesting third dimension to your photography. What inspired you to do this? 
JM: I started to do my first attempts with my digital camera, but then some months ago I found one of those vintage 3D cameras. The first inspiration was to do the “same photos” I have been doing for years but  with another touch, to make them alive. But then I realized I didn’t want to repeat the same photos, but to find specific moments and situations that look impressive with this technique. It doesn’t work with all situations.
