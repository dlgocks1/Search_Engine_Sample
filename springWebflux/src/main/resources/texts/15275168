KILLJOY officials want to move the zebra crossing featured on the cover of The 
Beatles' Abbey Road album - claiming it is a death trap.
Councillors say tourists flocking to be snapped on the road are causing 
crashes, with the accident rate on the rise.
There have been four more this decade than during the 80s and 90s.
Last weekend marked the 40th anniversary of the photo taken outside the Abbey 
Road recording studio in St John's Wood, North West London.
Hundreds of fans gathered there on Saturday as Sgt Pepper's Only Dartboard 
Band, dressed in replica clothing, played Beatles hits.
Fight
But Lindsey Hall, a councillor in the Abbey Road ward, pointed out there had 
been 22 accidents there since 2000.
She said: "Maybe it's time to end this once and for all and move the zebra 
crossing. It may end up with that."
Colleague Judith Warner added: "I have asked our transport department if it is 
in the most appropriate place."
Fans vowed to fight any attempts to move the iconic crossing. 
And last night a spokesman for Westminster City Council hinted they may let it 
be.
He said: "There is nothing to indicate any more cause for concern than on any 
other road."
