Vying for best designer collaboration to date (although fingers crossed Rodarte for Target will give this capsule line a run for its money), Jil Sander for Uniqlo, aka: +J, looks have leaked online. Vogue has a first look at the women's collection, while Hypebeast has posted images of what's in store for men. Not surprisingly the overall style is decidedly minimalist (a niche Sander helped carve with her namesake brand years ago), with streamline, straightforward basics for both men and women.
Think seamless, expertly cut suit separates, as well as a few slim-fitting, simple cardigans. Also of note: overcoats. Women in particular can start salivating over a timeless, military-inspired short overcoat; men, on the other hand, are being offered a sportier, hooded black, hip-length coat thatâ€™s sure to sell well. In other words, expect a snooze and loose situation when it comes to nailing pieces from the collection which according to rumors hits stores in October (though Uniqlo has yet to confirm a launch date).
