We ought to make a poll one day and record for posterity which is the most cloned handset in the history of cellphones, and we're pretty sure that the iPhone will end up with a podium finish. The EPhone i9s is yet another iPhone clone with a caveat - it features an invisible numeric keypad that appears whenever the handset is unlocked, making it look cool as well as a whole lot more convenient to dial your preferred contact when the situation calls for it. Apart from that, it features a built-in wireless spy camera that relies on short wave to transfer data. Transmission quality is said to be very good, while features like touch control, Bluetooth connectivity, MP3 support, Java and dual SIM slots round off the specifications for this $114 handset.
