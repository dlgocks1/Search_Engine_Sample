Inspiration is a great thing, every day I look through hundreds of submissions to Design You Trust, FFFound, Fubiz, GrafikCache, Lovely Package, SwissMiss and TheDieline in Google Reader, starring my favourites and saving them to my hard disk. This has grown into quite the collection since I started it 6 months ago so I thought I’d use this to me advantage and start posting collections of them here.
This week I’m looking at photography, and not just arty photos, but random shots of anything, or photos of installations or models. It’s all good in my book.
