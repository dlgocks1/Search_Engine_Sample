Free custom Particle World-based project
Even if you know that the built-in CC Particle World filter allows you to use images as a custom or "Textured" particles, you may want to look at Video Copilot's latest free After Effects project. To see a fuller scope of what Particle World can do, download the CycoreFX Particle World Demo. It's a poor man's version of Brian Maffitt's old demo in that you have to render each Comp separately and read along with the PDF.
