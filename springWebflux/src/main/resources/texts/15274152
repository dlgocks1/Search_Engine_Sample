A series of design explorations across 37signals products
By Jason Zimdars, designer at 37signals
One of the first projects for me as a new designer at 37signals is to take a fresh look at a series of features and screens in the company's applications. These individual pieces are ones that we know can be better but haven't made it onto anyone's plate yet. Much like the Highrise Contacts exploration I did a couple of months ago, I'll be looking at each piece intensively for a short period of time with the aim of improving and refining the experience. And also like the Highrise piece, I'll be carefully documenting the process, including the directions that didn't quite work. So stay tuned for more like this in the coming weeks.
