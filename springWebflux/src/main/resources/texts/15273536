Hashemi Rafsanjani cancels Friday sermon to avoid new Iranian crackdown
The former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani today backed away from further confrontation over the country's disputed presidential election by cancelling a potentially explosive Friday prayer sermon over fears it would trigger a renewed crackdown.In a surprise move, Rafsanjani said he would not lead this week's sermon at Tehran university as scheduled, for fear of provoking renewed violence by security forces against supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi, his reformist ally who says June's election was stolen from him.The decision came amid concerns of a repeat of events that surrounded Rafsanjani's sermon last month, when government forces fired tear gas and arrested dozens of Mousavi followers after they turned up in their thousands to register discontent over Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election.A statement from Rafsanjani's office said he would "not hold the political praying ceremony in order to avoid probable clashes". The announcement came in response to a flood of inquiries over whether the sermon would go ahead.The decision is highly unusual for Rafsanjani, who is Tehran's longest-serving Friday prayer leader and one of four clerics designated to lead the sermons.It appeared to signal a political climbdown after he used his previous sermon to challenge the political authority of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, by criticising the suppression and detention of demonstrators after the election.The impression was reinforced when it emerged Rafsanjani had failed to answer a letter from another reformist candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, alleging that male and female detainees had been raped."Some of the detainees of the unrest claim that the detained girls have been sexually assaulted with such brutality that they have all sustained intense vaginal tearing," Karroubi's letter said. "The young men in detention were also sexually assaulted in a manner that some are now suffering from depression and other physical and psychological problems and are incapable of even leaving their homes."Karroubi had called for the experts' assembly, a powerful clerical body headed by Rafsanjani, to investigate the allegations. But, according to his son, he decided to publish the claims after Rafsanjani failed to respond within a 10-day deadline.Rafsanjani has been identified by Ahmadinejad and his hardline supporters as the leading orchestrator of the post-election upheaval. Rafsanjani refused to attend a ceremony last week at which Khamenei officially endorsed Ahmadinejad's second term.In a speech in Mashhad last month, Ahmadinejad appeared to implicitly threaten Rafsanjani when he said that the leading person behind the unrest "should be seized by the collar and dragged to court".
