Many schools and kindergartens are now using D'Nealian script 
to teach handwriting. 
D'Nealian is a style of writing and teaching for cursive and print (block) 
handwriting. It was designed to ease the learning of cursive and print 
handwriting. It was developed by Donald Thurber, who developed the system while 
teaching in a primary school. It is reported that D'Nealian cursive handwriting, 
when it is taught to children, is, in theory, easier to learn and that 
students more quickly and easily acquire the skill with less frustration 
than traditional cursive writing systems. 
The system was designed as a method to alleviate the problems with teaching 
children the standard Zaner-Bloser Script method and the subsequent difficulty 
in transition to cursive writing. D'Nealian Script was unique in that the 
manuscript form has many similarities to the cursive version.
Here at ESL KidStuff we have over 
150 handwriting and alphabet worksheets using D'Nealian script.
