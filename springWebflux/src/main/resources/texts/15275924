This year, we received a record number of 925 valid
paper submissions -- a 24% submission increase over ACL-08: HLT --
with 569 full papers and 356 short papers. The significant
submission increase shows how vigorous our field is.
20 Area Chairs worked with 489 Program Committee members and 85 additional
reviewers to come up with 2,551 reviews, in total, for the final
paper selection. 21% of the full paper submissions are accepted;
all of these will be presented orally.  26% of the short paper
submissions are accepted; some of these will be presented orally
and some will be given as poster presentations. While short papers
are distinguished from full papers in the proceedings, there is no
distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented
orally and those presented as poster presentations. 
Furthermore, the short-paper posters are clustered together by
topic and assigned poster numbers, to provide better information
access for the audience and easier logistics for the Local
Arrangements Committee. 
Submissions and acceptances by areas
are as following:
