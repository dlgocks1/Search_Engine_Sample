Here's the second clip in the Hibari compilation series. It features *some* of the songs she recorded between 1950-1952. By the early 50's her popularity had grown rapidly, and she recorded 297 songs in just one decade from '50 to'59. Because of the number of songs, it was impossible for me to upload all of them, and besides, I haven't got that many. 
Note that I have uploaded only the first verse of each song. If anyone wants a song to be uploaded in full, or want me to upload their favourite song that isn't here, just ask me nicely, and I might do so providing I have the song either on CD, records, or cassette. 
I have uploaded the following;
1.私のボーイフレンド(Watashi no boyfriend) 1950
2.東京キッド (Tokyo Kid) 1950
3.拳銃ブギー (Kenjyu boogie) 1950
4.角兵衛獅子の唄(Kakubeijishi no uta) 1951
5.銀ブラ娘 (Ginbura musume) 1951
6.あの丘越えて(Anooka koete)1951
7.リンゴ追分(Ringo Oiwake)1952
8.お祭りマンボ(Omatsuri Mambo)1952
(BTW Pictured with Hibari in 'Kenjyu Boogie' is actor/singer Kouji Tsuruta, who starred with her in the motion picture 'Ano Oka Koete', and is said to be Hibari's first love.)
