I realized that many PN members were offended by my ratings, which is not really a surprise, but it has NOT been my intention. Let me first say that I rate the pictures based on my photographic experience and my overall artistic taste not based on other expectations or personal ties. 
I am a new member of the PN community but have been following its progress for a long time.
During this time, I've observed the ratings go higher and higher without apparent increase in quality of pictures. Noone seems to admit but there is an expectation that you buy good/bad rating by a good/bad rating. 
I am not sure what this rating game is good for?
If you'll accept only the good ratings but not the bad ones, then you are taking the ratings TOO seriously. In grand scheme of things, If your work is really good, the law of large numbers will determine the true value of your work, not the single number rendered by me. 
I am not a good photographer. I do not pretend to be a good photographer, if you are offended by my ratings you can simply blame me as an ignorant and mean person. Hope that relieves the pain somewhat. 
However, please do not get your hopes high or low with the ratings game, especially if the number of ratings is "statistically insignificant".
