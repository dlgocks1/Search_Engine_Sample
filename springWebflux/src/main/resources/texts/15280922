A GAA pitch in County Tyrone has been daubed with sectarian graffiti.Police said weed-killer was used to spell out sectarian slogans on the pitch at St Macartans Gaelic Football Club in Augher. Clogher Valley councillor Anthony McGonnell condemned the "senseless attack" and hoped it would be an "isolated incident". "This attack will not deter the club from continuing to offer a service to the local community," he said. "The Augher club is a testament to the hard work and community ethos the GAA in Tyrone inhabits and a lot of effort and money, all raised from the local community, has been spent in the past few years to make the facilities there one of the best around."
