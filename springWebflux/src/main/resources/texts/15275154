Notes
"Live to Air comprises an international compilation of artists' sound works. Forty-five artists were invited to make a work for the context of Audio Arts with an approximate duration of five minutes. The medium of magnetic tape, and the processes and technologies associated with sound recording, now represent a significant and growing area of art practice that has, until now, been largely overlooked. This work has no form other than playback from tape, as opposed to the recording function being used 'passively' as a method of retaining an acoustic event, or acting as a strategy for other work. Furthermore, the processes of working with sound provide artists with similar manipulative, structural and ideological freedoms and possibilities to those normally associated with the traditional media such as painting, sculpture and collage. In many respects, this audial/technological 'space' is parallel to the physical space of a gallery, yet extends it through the potential of widespread dissemination inherent in the multiple production of cassettes and through broadcasting.
