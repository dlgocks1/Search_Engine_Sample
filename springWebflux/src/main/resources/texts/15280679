Pocket Lucho has clearly given his all in his latest project, where this Neo Geo arcade cabinet mod certainly looks the part as a lean, mean, one-of-a-kind gaming machine. Underneath the exterior you will find a Neo Geo MVS mv1b board, a 5" PSOne LCD display as well as Space Invaders Play TV controls. Magnets have been used to make the wiring more accessible, while the exterior design is better thought out (and looks pretty good to boot). You'll need some major technical know how to conjure something like this during your spare time, as well as a love for gaming and electronics.
