The Internet is truly a wondrous place to visit if you have the right intentions - take Chinese farmer Wu Zhongyuan who actually built this helicopter from ground up all by himself, relying on bits and pieces of middle school physics lessons as well as "relevant knowledge [found while] surfing the Internet via my mobile phone." This single-seater DIY mode of transportation relies on Elm tree wood for its blades, while the frame itself has been reinforced with steel pipes. The entire project costs around $1,600 to construct, and is touted to be able to fly up to 2,600 feet.
