The next time you decide to spend some time alone (or with some good friends and family) outdoors, having a round of drinks with them is always much more fun as it helps open up conversations. This cooler does the job well, and to enhance the mood, it even comes with an integrated AM/FM radio as well as MP3 input, retailing for $25. There is no word on the number of batteries required to power this thing, but chances are you will need those fatty D sized batteries, which will in turn add to the weight tremendously. Ah well, no pain, no gain.
